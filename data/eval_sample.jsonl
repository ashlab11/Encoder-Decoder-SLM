{"text": "Mass. Medical, Dental Societies call for professional judgment in pain control\nSusan Spencer TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF\nMassachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Dental Society representatives say they're concerned about the misuse of prescribed medications, but also call for regulatory balance that allows prescribers to use their professional judgment to provide care that's best for patients.\n\"One of the unintended consequences is where you're so regulated, you're afraid to prescribe and people won't get the pain medication they need,\" said Dr. Ronald W. Dunlap, a cardiologist and president of the Medical Society. \"We all have different pain thresholds. Some people have terrible pain.\"\nDr. Dunlap said the Medical Society was working with regulators to make the state Department of Public Health's Prescription Monitoring Program, a database of controlled substance prescriptions, less burdensome to use.\nHe also said pharmacy chains have extensive databases that could be used with DPH's data to identify providers who prescribe a large number of opioids.\nDr. Thomas Trowbridge, an oral surgeon in Lowell and a trustee of the Dental Society, said, \"It's in our interest to promote the patient's appropriate amount of pain control.\"\nHe said adequately controlling pain hastens the healing process and helps patients get back to work or school.\nThe amount of medication needed varies by the weight and age of the patient, the procedure performed and other factors.\nDr. Trowbridge said that anecdotes about young people receiving large Vicodin or Percocet prescriptions after having their wisdom teeth removed needed to be taken in context.\n\"Often times it will be the first time for surgery where they've had to have pain control,\" Dr. Trowbridge said. But also, many people who don't share their anecdotes have wisdom teeth removed without notable post-surgery prescriptions, large or small.\n\"If we give them too few, it's been harder to call in more prescriptions,\" Dr. Trowbridge said, particularly for Schedule II drugs including Percocet and OxyContin, which in Massachusetts cannot be phoned in to the pharmacy.\n\"It's always good to have enough medicine ahead of time and prepare them for recovery.\""}
{"text": "The new U.S. National Defense Strategy: A \"good deal\" for the Military-Industrial Complex\nFeb 9th, 2018 +\nIn this article:defense, Military Strategy, Politics, society, United States, War\nOn January 19, 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis presented in Washington the declassified version of the United States' National Defense Strategy. In his speech, he made clear the militaristic approach that will be maintained in coming years: \"This strategy expands our competitive space, prioritizes preparedness for war.\"\nAccording to Mattis, the fight against terrorism will continue, \"but Great Power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of U.S. national security,\" which means a readjustment of the approach since the attacks of September 11, 2001. In line with the National Security Strategy of December 2017, Russia and China are identified as the main threats to the U.S. On a second level, are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iran, and the most dangerous non-state actor is identified as the Islamic State.\nThe document notes, \"The 2018 National Defense Strategy underpins our planned fiscal year 2019-2023 budgets, accelerating our modernization programs and devoting additional resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive advantage.\" In this sense, the U.S. will prioritize nuclear modernization, and investments in cyber and missile defense.\nThis the first time, in more than 15 years, that the U.S. has explicitly stated its interest in increasing military spending to maintain superiority over Russia and China, and consolidate its global hegemony. During this period, international terrorism served as the pretext for the strengthening of U.S. military forces, since after the fall of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the supposed threat that led the United States to exponentially increase its military budget after WWII, to the benefit of influential corporations, disappeared.\nThe language used recalls the Cold War era East-West conflict. The greatest exponent of the arms race was President Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 publicly launched the Strategic Defense Initiative, in which the scientific community was asked to develop a missile defense system to guarantee the protection of U.S. territory against a nuclear attack. It was also known as \"Star Wars,\" like the famous film of the time. As was shown that on that occasion, the only winner was \"the Military-Industrial Complex.\"\nThe current Strategy also reaffirms that the use of force will be applied as a foreign policy principle: \"Reinforcing America's traditional tools of diplomacy, the Department provides military options to ensure the President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength.\" In addition, it is noted that states are the main actors on the global scene, but that non-state actors, such as terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, and hackers, \"also threaten the security environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities.\"\nThe document emphasizes that the new strategy \"articulates our strategy to compete, deter, and win\" in this increasingly complex environment, stressing, \"The costs of not implementing this strategy are clear. Failure to meet our defense objectives will result in decreasing U.S. global influence, eroding cohesion among allies and partners, and reduced access to markets that will contribute to a decline in our prosperity and standard of living.\"\nIt is noted: \"A long-term strategic competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of national power – diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military,\" continuing: \"More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength.\" At the same time, it is claimed the U.S. \"is open to opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based on our national interests.\"\nLatin America and the Caribbean are mentioned only twice, referring to the Western Hemisphere, and unlike the Strategy of December 2017, no specific country of the region is mentioned. The objectives of the Strategy include \"maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere.\"\nAs outlined, the U.S. will deepen its relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries that \"contribute military capabilities to shared regional and global security challenges.\" The document also notes, \"The U.S. derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland.\"\nAlthough not recognized in the Strategy, it is worth mentioning that Latin America and the Caribbean is the most densely populated area in the world, and that more than half a century ago, it was declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone, through the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Last month marked four years since the 33 member countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), meeting at their Second Summit, in Havana January 28-29, 2014, declared \"Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.\"\nThis is the \"civilized\" world of the 21st century – some proclaim peace while others enact war. The Pentagon has revealed it is committed to building \"a more lethal force,\" in clear defiance of international peace, and to justify its 700 billion dollar military budget for 2018.\nThe Strategy defends President Donald Trump's nationalist electoral platform of \"America first,\" which combines diplomatic isolationism and economic protectionism, with military reinforcement and the denial of the threat of climate change. A \"novel\" formula to try to maintain global hegemony, and another \"good deal\" for the Military-Industrial Complex.\n2016 NATO spending by country with percentage of total\nIn millions of dollars\nU.S. 72.36% – $664.058\nUK 6.5% – $60.347\nFrance 4.7% – $43.620\nGermany 4.4% – $40.663\nItaly 2.3% – $21.878\nCanada 1.6% – $15.395\nTurkey 1.2% – $11.573\nSpain 1.2% – $11.064\nOthers 5.4% – $49.698"}
{"text": "Reader reviews and comments on Academy Street, plus links to write your own review.\nAcademy Street is the first novel by Irish author, Mary Costello. It chronicles the life of Teresa Lohan, from her youth in rural Ireland in the 1940s through her time in New York and her return to Ireland in her sixties. Tess is seemingly unremarkable, both as a child and an adult: a shy, sensitive child; a woman with an essential loneliness (\"It seemed at times that she was marooned on an island, a moat of water, wide and black, separating her from all human love.\"); a mother who feels she could have done better. Nonetheless, Costello's exquisite prose conveys this life with such emotion, such care, that the reader cannot help but be moved. Costello paints her character so vividly, so completely, that the reader can identify with Tess, her feelings (\"...the mark of all anxiety: the acute awareness of the endless possibilities that can simultaneously imperil and enhance us, and all that might be lost or gained.\"), her ideas (\"It Ireland seemed to her now to be a place without dreams, or where dreaming was prohibited. Here, life could be lived at a higher, truer pitch. Though her own was a timid life, there was, since Theo's birth, a yearning towards motion and spirit and vitality.\"), her reactions (\"She thought of the water that had lain quietly calm, each tiny drop, each molecule, restful, suddenly wrenched, catapulted through a metal rotary, tossed back out into the turbulent current, reeling, confounded, changed.\"). In both style and content, this novel is reminiscent of Sebastian Barry's work, in particular, \"On Canaan's Side\". A remarkable debut novel."}

{"text": "I love the sounds of Jerusalem. The voices, noises, and music all tell stories that are unparalleled in the Jewish world – and perhaps in the world at large. One I find so compelling is that of my story and the story of the \"other,\" which I hear simultaneously.\nThere a variety of others in Jerusalem – Arabic, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish, and Hebrew – and over the course of a week, I can listen and hear these voices and countless more. It is one of the incredible characteristics of our city.\nJoin me on a brief tour of some of the other voices I am so fortunate to hear regularly in Jerusalem.\nSaruat shared her voice honestly and directly, telling us she came to Hebrew University intent on learning, but determined never to interact with Jewish Israelis. It was a harsh message. Hearing about the challenges she faces as a person without a country was painful, too. But, we were inspired by the story of the journey that led Saruat to seek out interactions with Jewish Israelis.\nAt URJ Heller High, we make sure students have ample opportunities to hear voices of others whom they may not otherwise encounter. When they learn about contemporary Jewry, they meet an ultra-Orthodox couple (and representatives of other streams of Judaism). The encounter may be the only time students have the chance to listen to Haredi Jews talk about what they believe and represent, and how they are different from other Jews we may know.\nIt's important for students – and all of us – to listen with an open mind to people who express theological, philosophical, and practical opinions that are completely foreign to them and often contradict their own deeply held beliefs. Almost every semester, our ultra-Orthodox guests stay well past the allotted time to answer students' many questions.\nErev Shabbat, Friday night, at the Western Wall (the Kotel) is the time and place to hear your own voice and those of others at the same time. Two weeks ago, we were at the egalitarian Kotel for the first Kabbalat Shabbat service of the semester. Just as we started our service, the muezzin (Muslim prayer leader) started chanting the call to prayer over the loudspeakers of the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, and the Middle Eastern music echoed throughout the Kotel plaza. At the same time, a group of yeshiva students began their Kabbalat Shabbat prayers which rebounded off the Kotel and into the area where we were seated. From over the wall, we heard prayers of the multitude of minyanim (prayer groups) at the \"classic\" Kotel floating heavenward. Although there were no church bells ringing in the mix, you could easily imagine them joining in on the chorus of prayerful sounds. Sitting at the egalitarian Kotel, I asked the students to listen and take in the divine sounds of erev Shabbat at the Kotel. After listening, we added our own voices to the Friday night symphony that is the Kotel.\nThe Hebrew word \"sh'ma\" and its variants appear 303 times in the Torah. That one word appears so many times demands our attention. In a world in which truly listening to the other is quickly becoming a lost art, the Torah reminds us of the supreme importance of this act. Throughout the semester, our students have ample opportunities to cultivate this skill – in class with peers, in the dining hall with kibbutzniks, during mifgashim (get togethers) with Israeli high school peers, and during presentations by people who live extremely different lives than they do, including a former teacher who is now a settler and a Palestinian student who lives in East Jerusalem.\nHearing and listening to these varied sounds and voices of Jerusalem and Israel – and finding value in both those that are familiar and those that are \"other\" – give students their own incredible stories to tell when they return home at the end of the semester.\nRabbi Loren Sykes lives in Jerusalem, Israel, where he is the principal of URJ Heller High."}

Within minutes, deputies at a nearby sheriff's department substation entered the school and arrested the two suspects after a struggle.\n\"As officers were arriving at the school, they could still hear gunshots,\" Douglas County Undersheriff Holly Nicholson-Kluth said.\nAuthorities did not release the name of the student who died, but said it was an 18-year-old man.\n\"I have to believe that the quick response of the officers that got inside that school helped save lives,\" Spurlock said. He did not identify the suspects, but said they are an adult and a minor who were not previously known to authorities. Authorities planned to search their homes and a vehicle at the school, he said.\nThe shooting comes nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the grim 20th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre that killed 13 people. The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) in adjacent communities south of Denver. It also comes exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\nThe STEM School Highlands Ranch is a public charter school with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades.\nWitness accounts\nStudent Christian Paulson told television station KMGH that he was in study hall when he saw kids running and shouting, \"School shooter!\"\n\"And I'm like, what? Is this real or fake? And then I just went after them,\" Christian Paulson said. \"And apparently, this is all real. And I tried to run with my life, but I'm out of breath.\"\nRocco DeChalk, who lives near the school, told television station KUSA that he saw so many students running past his house that at first he thought it was a gym class. He went outside and saw a teenage boy who had been shot in the back being helped by a teacher and another student.\nThey brought the boy into his kitchen and alerted a police officer, who sent for an ambulance.\n\"He made a comment, 'Oh, I'm starting to feel it now,'\" DeChalk said. \"I told him that was probably the adrenaline kicking in and he was going into shock.\"\nThree area hospitals reported treating eight people in connection with the attack. Two were listed in serious condition, two were listed as stable, one was in good condition and three were released.\nEvacuating students\nLines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school, and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field.\nThe sheriff's office directed parents to a nearby recreational center to pick up their children. A fleet of school buses arrived and dropped off students, some of whom were crying and holding hands with their classmates as they were helped off. An ambulance also pulled up and let out a half-dozen children, none of whom appeared to be physically injured.\n\"We know this is a very worrisome situation for parents,\" Nicholson-Kluth said. \"Relatives are worried, and we are trying to get them back together as soon as possible.\"\nGov.

{"text": "Spin or Whoppers?\nOver the last decade, the media have become obsessed with 'spin'. It's rare to pick up a newspaper without some reference to it. We have satirical programmes about it. But, I'm not sure there is any more of it today than when Bernard Ingham span for Margaret Thatcher, although it's probably more professionally done nowadays.\nWe shouldn't be surprised by 'spin', for it is simply 'putting the best gloss on your story'. Surely nobody expects that anyone, whose reputation is in the public arena, would deliberately go out to 'put the worst gloss' on what they want to say?\nBut there is a big difference between 'spin' and 'telling whoppers'. I only wish our media became more obsessed with the latter than the former. In that way, they would do a public service by properly holding public representatives to account.\nMy Barnsley colleague, Michael Dugher, has just published a long list of 'Whoppers' that David Cameron has told at Prime Ministers' Questions over the last 12 months. Of course, we all occasionally make mistakes. Last week, my friend David Blunkett got something wrong in an interview on Radio 4; but, discovering his mistake, he was back on the radio within 30 minutes to apologise and to correct his error. But, to the best of my knowledge, David Cameron hasn't once set about correcting one of his 'whoppers'. He does us all a dis-service.\nAnd these things are not unimportant, because our Prime Ministers's statements are publicised throughout the world and, if left uncorrected, give a clearly wrong impression of what is happening. Judge for yourself, with these examples of what Mr Cameron said at PMQs on January 25th and what the facts actually are:\nDavid Cameron: \"Hospital waiting times are down\"\nFact: The number of patients not being treated within 18 weeks has soared by 43% since Mr Cameron became PM\nDavid Cameron: \"Disabled children will not have their benefits cut.\"\nFact: Department for Work and Pensions' assessment on the new universal credit showing that the rate paid to disabled children will fall from £53.84 to £26.75 a week.\nDavid Cameron: \"There are more people in work today than there were at the time of the last election\"\nFact: The Office for National Statistics says there are now 26,000 fewer people in work than at the last election.\nI'd prefer more spin and fewer whoppers."}

{"text": "Invisible Hands\nVOICES FROM THE GLOBAL ECONOMY\nEdited by Corrine Goria Foreword by Kalpona Akter\nThe men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy.\nThe men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy. These narrators — including phone manufacturers in China, copper miners in Zambia, garment workers in Bangladesh, and farmers around the world — reveal the secret history of the things we buy, including lives and communities devastated by low wages, environmental degradation, and political repression. Sweeping in scope and rich in detail, these stories capture the interconnectivity of all people struggling to support themselves and their families. Narrators include Kalpona, a leading Bangladeshi labor organizer who led her first strike at 15; Han, who, as a teenager, began assembling circuit boards for an international electronics company based in Seoul; Albert, a copper miner in Zambia who, during a wage protest, was shot by representatives of the Chinese-owned mining company that he worked for; and Sanjay, who grew up in the shadow of the Bhopal chemical disaster, one of the worst industrial accidents in history.\n\"A compelling message about the plight of labor workers worldwide...Hope for change comes in various forms throughout Goria's collection, including the strides made by Bangladesh worker Kalpona Akter, who, after years working in a textile mill, became a staunch activist and labor rights advocate. Their common trait, aside from a laborious livelihood, is a marked desire to initiate a movement to bar unreasonable and perilous working conditions and unfair wages. Goria dramatically acknowledges the legion of overlooked workers who 'produce the things we use every day,'expressed through the carefully chosen words of crusaders who share each other's individual hopes and hardships. Powerful and revealing testimony to the injustices of manual labor, infused with inspiration for global change.\" —Kirkus Reviews\n\"Compiled and edited by lawyer Goria, these oral accounts of labor abuses and the struggles of the working poor cover most corners of the globalized economy. Stories from workers and labor activists in far-flung locations, including Mexico, Zambia, Bangladesh, China, and South Korea, convey a sobering uniformity of harsh working conditions, low wages, coerced labor, and ruthless retribution against unions and advocates for workers' rights. Readers hear from Bangladeshi garment workers who struggled to get monthly minimum wages raised from $15 in 1994 to $43 by 2010; Indian farmers trapped in a cycle of borrowing, debt, and bankruptcy; and the Chinese factory worker whose journey to the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen started with excitement and ended with an accident that cost him a hand. A more hopeful strain about the resilience of labor emerges in some narratives: 'Never think that you're less than the boss,' counsels Ana Juarez, a Mexican garment worker and activist. As Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor rights advocate, says: 'It was hard for me to tell my story for this book and to make my life so public' but . . . 'if it lets another woman who has faced exploitation and repression feel that she is not alone, and even encourages her to speak up, then it is worth it.'\" —Publishers Weekly\n\"This book, edited by attorney Goria, uses oral history to introduce readers to 16 disadvantaged employees working in agriculture, the garment industry, natural resources, and electronics manufacturing in countries including India, Zambia, and the United States. These workers discuss their experiences with unsafe workplace conditions, organized labor, poor wages, and immigration. The interviews serve to educate readers about the working conditions of low-wage workers around the world and draw their attention to the challenges faced by employees toiling in less than desirable—and often unsafe—conditions. The book includes a time line of modern industrialization, a glossary, historical capsules providing context for the oral histories in the book, and an overview of the global decline of garment-industry wages. Readers interested in the plight of disadvantaged workers worldwide as well as the undesirable effects of globalization will be likewise interested in this book. VERDICT: Recommended for a wide range of readers, from those served by high school libraries and public and academic ones as well.\" —Nathan Rupp, Library Journal"}

{"text": "Bully-boy pro lifers stake out prime minister's home - shameful tactics do nothing but fuel anger in abortion debate\nDaniel O'Carroll\nEnda Kenny: Irish Taoiseach target of aggressive abuse over abortion legislation.\nPro life campaigners aggrieved at proposed legislation which would legalize abortion under limited circumstances have been mounting a vitriolic campaign of abuse against Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny in recent weeks.\nIn doing so they have seriously undermined the cause they profess to serve and sustained images of a vigilante mob attempting to suppress dissenting views through crude intimidation.\nThe latest in a series of disquieting incidents has seen masked men campaigning outside the Castlebar home of the Taoiseach while his wife and son were at home yesterday before being removed by police.\nEarlier that day, Kenny was repeatedly heckled as he tried to conduct an opening ceremony at a completely unrelated commemoration ceremony in County Longford where he faced charges that he was proposing to \"kill the unborn\" in supporting the Bill.\nLast week he disclosed to the Dáil how he had received letter written in blood, sarcastic medals, plastic fetuses, and medical scapulars as result of the legislation, now in draft stage, which would allow abortions to be performed where the mother's life was in imminent danger as a result of the pregnancy.\nDespite Kenny's fervent Catholicism, he has sustained his mantra that \"my book is the Constitution\" and has refused to back down in the face of the often unsavory methodologies being employed by those opposed to the passage of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.\nOther politicians have been similarly inundated with phone calls from both legitimate pro-life lobbyists and more dubious vigilante crooks.\nOne politician described the concerted effort as a programme of \"widespread intimidation\", saying that politicians had been spat at and people had been turning up at their homes at unusual hours in desperate attempts to convince them to vote against the proposals.\nOne female TD, allegedly, received a threat that her throat would be cut. should she vote with the government.\nEach TD (member of parliament) is estimated to be receiving 50 telephone calls a week from those opposed to the idea -- a relatively vast volume in a country with a comparatively small tradition of organized political lobbying.\nLast December the communications regulator was forced to intervene after members of the public reported a spate of automated telephone calls beseeching them to lobby their TDs to oppose the Bill. The 'robo calls' were accompanied by graphic anti-abortion posters, some targeting individual TDs.\nThose opposing the legislation are usually referred to as the 'pro-life' movement and comprise a broad swathe of religious Catholic voters as well as those opposed to the idea of any kind of abortion on atheist moral grounds.\nThey either argue that any kind of abortion is tantamount to murder or that the legislation is the first step on a road towards abortion on demand.\n'Pro choice' activists, the legislation's proponents, support a woman's right to chose to have an abortion or not.\nThe legislation represents the government's decision to legislate on the X case after the untimely demise of Savita Halappanavar. The hospital patient died of complications following doctors' refusal to grant her an abortion.\nWhile pro life activists' views resonate with a significant proportion of the population, even many of their supporters would question the propriety of intimidating members of the Taoiseach's family at their private home.\nOn the rare occasions where protests do take place outside a politician's family dwelling -- such as a similar anti-abortion demonstration outside Justice Minister Alan Shatter's private residence -- they are usually roundly condemned; I believe rightly so.\nMaking a case against abortion is a perfectly legitimate activity and on such a divisive issue was guaranteed to happen.\nBut resorting to the kind of sustained intimidation leveled against public representatives in recent weeks generates endless negative PR for the pro-life campaign and casts them in the prototypical role of agents of the controlling Catholic church which dominated the Ireland of yesteryear.\nLeader of the opposition party Fianna Fáil's decision to remove his party's whip system for the vote (effectively, allowing TDs to vote with their conscience and contravene party policy without the prospect of consequences) was an inspired move which removes personal responsibility accruing to TDs and ensures that they won't be forced to compromise their religious beliefs on the issue.\nHopefully the party's representatives as well as those voting along party lines can cast their ballot without having suffered through such abuse.\n(Correction: Subsequent to this post being sent for publication, a fathers' rights group, not affiliated with the pro life movement, claimed responsibility for the protest.)"}

{"text": "This week's portion, Shimini, carries us deeper into the book of Leviticus.\nThe first half of the portion is the initiation of the sacrificial cult: the Torah describes in dramatic fashion the first sacrifices Aaron and his sons carry out in their role as priests. They slaughter various animals corresponding to the different types of offerings, they splatter blood on the altar and fire consumes the corpses. Aaron and his sons then bless the people and the people fall on their faces.\nThe second half of the portion is an explication of the dietary laws. We are told specifically which animals are kosher and which are not: we learn that kosher land animals have cloven hooves and are ruminants, kosher birds are not birds of prey and kosher sea creatures have fins and scales. We also learn some other regulations as to what may or may not be eaten.\nThere are many questions raised by this short passage, but we can understand from the text that Nadav and Avihu did something wrong, and they were punished for their transgression.\nPut in context with the passage that came before, we can have an understanding of what perhaps their transgression was. The Torah says they offered \"alien fire, which God had not enjoined upon them.\" Earlier in the parasha, when describing the initial sacrifices, the Torah says, at various times, \"this is what God has commanded,\" and \"according to regulation\" and \"as Moses had commanded.\" What the Torah is telling us is that while the first set of sacrifices was what was commanded, what Nadav and Avihu offered was not. Essentially what they were doing was offering a sacrifice that was outside the norm of the ordained and organized system of sacrifices.\nIt seems very extreme, though. Did they really deserve death for a slight deviation from the norm? And besides, is what they did so wrong? It can be argued that what Nadav and Avihu did when they offered the additional sacrifice was to further glorify God—they were not offering something in contradistinction to, but rather in addition to, what was proscribed, due to their zeal, or desire to serve, or love of Torah.\nThis may be, but what perhaps the Torah is trying to teach us in this story is the perils of individualism. The extreme nature of the story aside—and this isn't the first time a story in the Torah is extreme it its details—the Torah is showing us that by branching off on their own Nadav and Avihu were violating their communal responsibility and trust to the detriment of the whole. They system of sacrifices for the entire Israelite community was set. In making their own offering outside these norms, Nadav and Avihu were placing their own desires above the norms of the community. They were acting in their own self-interest. But for Nadav and Avihu, who were leaders and priests, it can't just be about them. It has to be about the whole.\nThis mindset does not just fall upon our leaders, but upon all of us who live in community. When we fail to take into account our communal responsibility, and we privilege ourselves over others, we privilege individualism over communalism, we weaken our social bonds.\nIndividualism is different than individuality. We are of course all individuals, we have our own likes and dislikes, ideas and dreams, needs and desires. We make our own choices and set our own path. But we do not live in a vacuum, we are part of a communal whole. We pursue our own paths within the context of others, and we have a responsibility and obligation to keep the needs and desires of others in mind as we seek to fulfill our own needs and desires.\nIn our day this can take many forms. The recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland brought the issue of vaccinations—and those who opt-out—to the fore. Locally the issue led to the public revelation of vaccination rates, and Yohanna and I discovered that Erez's elementary school had one of the highest unvaccinated rates. This was startling and unnerving. I don't need to get into issues of \"herd immunity\" or scientific detail, but to simply say that vaccines work because we all agree to use them. They are part of a social contract—we agree to abide by certain guidelines when we live in community, and when we privilege the self over the other—individualism over communalism—then we violate that contract.\nYes, we need to honor the individuality of each person, and do what we can to support those individual journeys. But we need to be mindful so that individuality does not become individualism.\nNadav and Avihu broke the rules. There are times we go must outside the box, and we need to do things differently. There are times we must think creatively, and we need to challenge the existing norms. But we must ask, to what end? If it is to serve others and a greater good, then that is something we should pursue. But if it is to serve our own self interest at the expense of others, then, as in the case of Nadav and Avihu, it is a transgression and there will be consequences."}

{"text": "This beautiful DIY Citrus Mint hand soap is made with essential oils and makes a great gift!\nSo who says that soap needs to be purely utilitarian? I don't know about you, but when it comes to my hand soap, I am drawn to two key things; scent and packaging, hands down. I have always been a packaging junkie and just a sucker for beautiful design. I love to go to stores and just look at all of the different ways companies have branded their products. I pay special attention to the colors, patterns and textures of the paper used. I think it's the marketer in me or maybe I'm just a geek... there's that.\nOne other important area that we just can't avoid is the topic of chemicals. Yes, those nasty chemicals that have found their way into all of our health and beauty products. Do you remember the antibacterial craze? OMG! It was like the companies and the media were telling us to live in a sterile bubble. It was so bad that people were ready to go add a hazmat suit to their daily wardrobe. There were antibacterial soaps, wipes, you name it. We became this germophobe society where \"pass the Purell\" became a thing at every social event.\nSo why is all this so bad? Well you see, we need our immune systems to keep us healthy, and by over using all of these antibacterial products, we start to kill those natural fighters in our bodies. Last year the FDA finally announced that there was not enough scientific evidence to show that over-the-counter antibacterial soaps were better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. If you want to find out more about the nasty chemicals, just google Triclosan, but make sure you are sitting down when you read about what types of chemicals have been allowed in our products. It is not pretty!\nWell enough of being a Debbie downer. Let's get on with the good stuff. This hand soap could not be easier to make with just a hand full of ingredients, that won't compromise your immune system.\nWe will be scenting our soap with essential oils which not only smell amazing, but have some great health benefits. I spoke about essential oils in my Essential Oils 101 post. This is a awesome place to start, especially if you are new to essential oils.\nFor this blend, I chose peppermint, lemon, lemongrass and tea tree essential oils. I love the citrusy aroma of the lemon and the lemongrass, paired with the peppermint, and the tea tree acts as an antibacterial. I like the addition of a little almond or jojoba oil to the blend to make sure that the soap doesn't dry out our hands. I mean, I live in MN so we do not need any extra dryness to our hands, especially in the winter.\nSo let's talk about these labels. Aren't they lovely? I made them especially for you....awe. You can print them here Citrus Mint Hand Soap Label. I couldn't give you a recipe for this great soap and leave you with some boring labeless vessel to put it in. Remember, it's all about the packaging. If you go the label route, you're definitely going to want to make sure you waterproof them, so please see the instructions in the recipe card found at the bottom of this post. You don't want to spend time making this beautiful handmade loveliness and then one pump of the soap and your ink has runneth away.\nI always make a couple extra bottles when I make a batch, because you never know when you need a quick last minute hostess gift. Pair this soap with a couple of nice dish or hand towels in a pretty basket and you have a fabulous, stylish, handmade gift. Who doesn't love something handmade?\nThis luxurious, DIY hand soap is made with essential oils, is easy to make, and makes a great gift.\nPlace water and liquid soap in a glass container with a spout. Mix together until blended.\nAdd essential oils and almond/jojoba oil. Blend until combined.

Office of the Director.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting today that a small amount of material from an Ebola virus experiment that was securely transported from a Select‐Agent‐approved BSL‐4 lab to a Select‐Agent‐ approved BSL‐2 lab may have contained live virus. The material was on a sealed plate but should not have been moved into the BSL‐2 laboratory. We cannot rule out possible exposure of the one laboratory technician who worked with the material in the BSL‐2 laboratory.\tThere was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public. The event was discovered by the laboratory scientists yesterday, December 23, and reported to leadership within an hour of the discovery.\tThe event is under internal investigation by CDC, was reported to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, and reporting to the internal and national Select Agent Programs has been initiated. CDC will provide a report on the event when the investigation concludes. The BSL‐2 laboratory area had already been decontaminated and the material destroyed as a routine procedure before the error was identified. The laboratory was decontaminated for a second time, and is now closed and transfers from the BSL‐4 lab have been stopped while the review is taking place.\t\"I am troubled by this incident in our Ebola research laboratory in Atlanta,\" said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \"We are monitoring the health of one technician who could possibly have been exposed and I have directed that there be a full review of every aspect of the incident and that CDC take all necessary measures. Thousands of laboratory scientists in more than 150 labs throughout CDC have taken extraordinary steps in recent months to improve safety. No risk to staff is acceptable, and our efforts to improve lab safety are essential ‐‐the safety of our employees is our highest priority.\"\tCDC will continue to provide support during the Ebola epidemic through its research and diagnostic lab work. Skilled lab scientists in the Ebola response are valued contributors to ending this epidemic.\tBased on what was learned during the lab science and safety reviews earlier this year, CDC has taken several immediate actions in this incident including closure of the laboratory, notification of staff, initiation of a complete internal review, and notifications of regulatory oversight agencies. This review will give us a clear understanding of what happened in this case and what can be done to further improve laboratory safety.\tCDC has established a CDC‐wide single point of accountability for laboratory science and safety and this will aid in ensuring accountability in this situation.\tCDC will also report this event to its external advisory committee which provides ongoing advice and direction for laboratory science and safety.\nContainment Of Biohazards\nHemorrhagic Fever, Ebola\nLaboratory Infection/prevention & Control\nStephen B.

The majority of vehicles we have tested will flow over 1 gallon per minute.\nWhat should I do if the Truck/Van Gas Transfer System causes my vehicle to stall when I use it?\nAlthough this situation is very rare, you can prevent your vehicle from stalling by adjusting the Flow Valve on the back of the unit. Instead of turning this valve all the way open you can try opening it only 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 of the way.\nIs the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system PT500 approved for use in California and other EPA regulated States?\nYes this system has been approved for sale in California and all EPA regulated states.\nCan the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system be used with Diesel?\nNo this system is designed to only work on gasoline applications.\nHow do I know if the PT500 Truck/Van Gas Transfer System will work with my vehicle?\nThe system was designed to work on any Fuel Injected Truck or Van that has factory installed quick disconnect Fuel Lines. Most trucks from the Late 1990's and newer have these connections. If you are not sure you can take a look at your vehicle Fuel Line to see if it is equipped with quick disconnects.\nWill the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system work on my motorcycle?\nThe system uses the factory quick disconnect fuel lines on 2001 and Newer Fuel-Injected Harley Davidson bikes; therefore it will only connect to those motorcycles. However you can still pump fuel into any brand motorcycle as long as the host bike is a Fuel Injected Harley.\nIs the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system a permanent installation?\nNo, the systems uses quick disconnects which allows it to be installed and removed in just seconds. After use just simply pack the system away in the provided storage pouch.\nWhat should I do if there is fuel leaking from where I connected the MC100 system to my motorcycle?\nFirst turn off the motorcycle and remove the MC100 system. Take a look up inside the motorcycles factory quick disconnect check valve and inspect the lower O-Ring. The majority of the time this O-Ring will be dried up or damaged from the Ethanol in fuels available today that eat away at the factory O-Rings.

Try to apply only a slight amount of pressure while rotating the handle with the hook clockwise. You will feel the hook grab the O-Ring and then at this point you can pull straight down and the O-Ring should come right out. This may take a few tries to get the proper feel.

A slight 57-year-old from the nearby village of Colaba, Sawant is in his 30th year as a dabbawala (\"one who carries the box\"), part of an army of white-clad men who deliver about 200,000 homecooked lunches to Mumbai's workers each day.\nSince the 1890s, dabbawalas have navigated this city's crowded, chaotic streets, riding heavy bicycles with lunch tins—picked up from various workers' homes—dangling from the handlebars. Endurance is vital, as is an encyclopedic knowledge of the city: Mumbai's dabbawalas are said to make one error per 6 million deliveries, and any deviation from this rate is not taken lightly.\nThe traffic, as ever, is terrible, but the car eventually glides to a stop at the set of a Bollywood musical. Followed by a videographer, Sawant hands food to the young dancers, punctuating his delivery with the same courteous bow he always offers his customers. And that's that. The camera is switched off.

{"text": "Why Hire A Trial Attorney?\nOhio Supreme Court: Warrantless search of student backpack was OK\nOn behalf of The Law Offices of Saia & Piatt, Inc. | May 18, 2017 | Criminal Defense\nIf a high school student leaves his backpack on the bus, would it be fair for him or her to expect it to be left unopened? Would it put anyone in danger? What if there was a rumor the student was a gang member?\nThese are the questions the Ohio Supreme Court recently answered in the case of a Columbus high school student who was charged with possession of a deadly weapon after leaving his bag unattended on a bus.\nA little background: The U.S. Supreme Court had already found in the 1991 case of Florida v. Bostick that bag searches on buses are constitutionally doubtful in the best of circumstances. However, that differs somewhat from the one heard by the Ohio Supreme Court. Moreover, students have less privacy rights than adults.\nCouldn't any unattended bag contain a bomb?\nAccording to the Courthouse News Service, on one February morning in 2013, a student left his backpack on a bus. A school security guard found it and opened it only enough to identify its probable owner. Based on a rumor that the student was a gang member, however, he brought the backpack to the school principal instead of returning it to the student.\nThe school principal felt free to empty the bag, and inside they found bullets. The pair then contacted a police officer.\nThe principal, the security guard and the police officer confronted the student in a hallway, where the police officer executed a take-down and incapacitated the student.\nThey then searched another bag the student had on his person. Inside there was a gun.\nThe student was charged with possession of a deadly weapon, and argued that these searches were unreasonable — and therefore illegal under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He asked for the evidence to be suppressed, and both the trial court and the Franklin County Appeals Court agreed.\nThe Ohio Supreme Court disagreed and sent his case back to trial. First, the court reaffirmed that schools are \"special needs\" settings that allow more warrantless searches than would be allowed for adults.\nNext, they reasoned that at each step, the child's right to privacy was outweighed by the \"In compelling governmental interest in protecting public-school students from physical harm.\"\nAfter all, they reasoned, any unattended bag could contain a tiny explosive device fashioned out of carbon dioxide cartridges called a 'cricket bomb' like those attempted by the Columbine High School shooters. Such a bomb might not be noticed in a cursory search meant merely to identify the owner of the bag.\nUnder circumstances like those — however unlikely they might seem — surely the search was reasonable?\nLiquor Laws (3)\nOVI (77)\nOVI Defense (8)\nTraffic Law (4)\nWhy new parents need an estate plan\nEasing the financial stress of co-parenting after a divorce\nWhen should an estate plan be updated?\nCreating an estate plan amidst a major crisis in life\nOhio's Administrative License Suspension may sound unjust\nA Nationally Recognized Law Firm\nStart Fighting Today\n98 North Union Street\nMt.

{"text": "Would the BBC work better as a company, charity, instead of a new Royal charter?\nThe BBC exists because, every ten years, the monarch has granted another Charter. Given the changes in the media landscape in the last decades, should the BBC move to another status?\nBBC, plc 2017\nIn a set of articles earlier in the year, I investigated the BBC as a public company, sometimes run by subscription and other times by adverts and by subscription.\nBritish Broadcasting Charity\nOne option that must be on the table is the change in the BBC from having a Royal Charter to being a charity.\nThe claims for the BBC's Royal Charter seem to be rather bust these days. Aside from the democratic implications in the 21st century of the head of state being able to make law by proclamation, the claimed benefits are long since gone.\nThe last three Prime Ministers have done away with once-treasured the BBC News independence.\nTony Blair used the strategy of a judge-lead whitewash (using the logic \"the Prime Minister cannot lie because he is the Prime Minister\") to weaken the independent broadcaster.\nGordon Brown, by providing \"free\" TV Licences to pensioners allowed the state to co-opt a sizable part of the funds supposedly hypothecated from the TV Fee. He could have provided pensioners with a £150 uplift in their pensions.\nThis pensioner allocation was used by Prime Minister David Cameron to strong arm DG Thompson into cutting back the BBC in an egregious funding settlement.\nIt is clear that the BBC is no longer independent of government, the Royal Charter special guarantee no longer respected by Ministers \"of the Crown\".\nSo, perhaps it would be sensible to do away with the 10-year cycle of renegotiation and move the Broadcaster to the status of the British Broadcasting Charity, and hope that the Charity Commission can provide a better protection for our national broadcaster than elderly monarch does.\nBBC salami-slicing returns to overnight services? 1\n#GreatBBC campaign launched 2\nGoodbye BBC Red Button! 3\nWant to know how much the BBC spend in England, Scotland, Wales and NI per home? 4\nS4C and Welsh Exceptionalism? 5\nBBC future: make sure you make the deadline 6\nSandra Blickem\nI am constantly disappointed with the BBC\nThe news is sparse in content and appears very biased\nThe scheduling is terrible putting one programme type on two or three channels at the same time, ie sport\nInstead of putting sport specials on the \"secondary\" channels 3 or 4 they remove other popular regulars altogether, very annoying\nTheir presenters are becoming less and less able, amicable, too serious, biased and non-entertaining!\nThey ignore complaints and criticism and simply carry on as before\nTheir sound is often compromised ie Jamaica Inn and I've noticed several others that are too loud, too quiet, too mumbled!\nI seriously wonder what is going on with them as a previously non-biased, friendly, intelligent people's\" channel!\nSandra Blickem's 1 post\nMartin Baines\nIt seems to me, no-one really wants to ask the hard question: what is the BBC for?\nIt seems to me that the only rational justification for a compulsory tax given to just one broadcaster is to do the things the market does not do but are somehow considered a universal good.\nIf we deconstruct this, it used to be argued the BBC was the only way quality drama got made, not nasty populist stuff. Yet today, while the BBC still makes good programmes, it cannot claim a monopoly of good output - in fact I think one could argue it has been left behind by US subscription and internet makers like HBO, Showtime, ANC and NETFLIX.\nSimilarly in sport - once the BBC was felt necessary to ensure \"national\" sporting events got coverage, yet again that is clearly no longer the case. Yes the BBC still does a good job but its fund are such that it often is behind its commercial rivals. Perhaps sport would actually be better served by not having the BBC do it at all and regulating for free to air access for those supposed \"national\" events?\nSimilar arguments can be made on things like the arts, yet again we now have whole channels devoted to them that do as good (if not better) jobs of covering niche material.\nSo that finally leave The News. It is often argued the BBC is the gold standard of unbiased coverage with unrivalled worldwide news gathering. Yet the \"unbiased\" is clearly not true: in the name of spurious \"balance\" it veers between bland no reporting and biased coverage to plate whoever last called foul against them. Just look at the current controversy around UKIP - the BBC went from treating them as fringe party worthy of little but a joke to now being accused of ever coverage by virtually all other parties. And can we really say the BBC on screen news does a better job than ITV News, Channel 4 News, Sky News or Al Jazeera?\nNow none of that says the BBC is bad. In fact I think it is (generally) very good at what it does, but I cannot honestly see how we can justify the compulsion element any longer. My own view is that it would have better future as some sort of independent organisation or even split up. I am pretty sure the Drama output would survive in its own right (just look at how well BBC Worldwide does). Similarly news gathering is first class, and may, if freed from its government shackles, do even better providing either its own channels globally or perhaps as a source provider like Reuters. Perhaps keep The World Service as a state global propaganda arm funded by the Foreign Office as it was until the last charter settlement.\nMartin Baines's 14 posts\nSandra Blickem: Do you have actual data to support any of those very vague accusations? Biased? To who?\nI hate sport, but at the weekend, there is a lot of sport, and they only have two channels to show it (BBC3 & 4 share with CBBC & Cbeebies) - in reality they dont show sport on all channels all day.\nAnd if someone is covering a terrible disaster or questioning a politician, why would I want them to be other than 'too serious'. And the sound not being perfect on Jamica Inn is no more than a storm in a teacup. Sound is generally worse on all TV's these day - try listening to the other channels - the BBC is no better or worse.\nMartin Baines: Think of what would happen if there was no BBC. No Proms, no real kids TV (trust me, Cbeebies and CBBC are fantastic), but lots of reality shows, soaps and 'dramas'. I dont always like the BBC either, but when I look at other countries output, I'm not always impressed either. I think Roy Greenslade made an excellent argument as to why the BBC should contine in its current form: Why the public must rally to support the BBC licence fee | Media | theguardian.com\nI'm sick of the 'American TV is best/we have Netflix's' arguement. Firstly, we get the cream of the crop of US shows. Much of its is dross. In fact most shows dont make it past the pilot, never mind the first series. And while there is a lot of fantastic drama from the US, its a media market at least five times larger than our own. I'd expect more great drama.\nHBO, Showtime, ANC, etc are all cable channels where you subscribe, and where the programme makers are often allowed to take risks without fear of advertisers, language, content, etc. Have a look at the main US broadcast channels. Do you really think Hawaii 50 is better than Line of Duty?\nNetflix's? Netflix is a distributor of content, although like most other distributors, from the time of the 2 reelers, its moved into production as well. Its first big production? An adapation of a set of books made famous on TV by an TV adaption from the BBC...\nNetflix is great if you have fast broadband, and you want to watch a lot of different stuff (although relative poor compared with what the US site has to offer). Yet the huge majority of TV watched in the UK is live - its not even recorded.\nSport? I hate sport generally, but if the alternative is paying money to Rupert Murdoch, then the BBC should be allowed to cover sports.\nDrama? There are fantastic drama's on the BBC. Its been a really good year. Yes, some want more risk-taking, but overall, its been great. There should be no need to say US is better than UK - both have great stuff, but do things in slightly different ways, as this article pointed out: American vs British drama: why do we have to pick a side? | Television & radio | theguardian.com\nArts? The BBC produces a huge amounts of stuff on the arts - and although Sky has two channels devoted to it, you have to pay more than your licence fee to watch them, and I suspect that they (and Sky Atlantic) are loss leaders to encourage people people like me to make the leap to Sky. If there was no BBC, then I suspect they would go in an instant.\nNews? Not always great - and I complain when its isn't. But overall, its has a huge range and can be brilliant. I have no desire to get my news in the same way as the US - which is perhaps why NPR uses the World Service so much. Are there really shackles on its news gathering? The joy of the World Serive is that it is seen as not just government propaganda. It might be the cheapest 'soft power' weapon the UK has, and its would better if the Foriegn Office coughed up for its upkeep, but thats not the BBC's fault.\nYou yourself admit that the BBC is very good at what it does, and I'm in total agreement. But you then say it should be broken up because the market can do it better, and that its a compulsory tax. I'm not sure the market can do it better, and if doesn't, then it will impossible to put the BBC back together again.\nThe tax thing is a bit like the whinging you get from libertarian types - 'its because of 'fredum' and 'rights'. Its rational, but only within a very particular worldview, and totally misses the point. Your 'made' to pay for lots of stuff you might never use via taxation, but why pick on something that you do use?\nSince 99.9% of people in the UK use the BBC on a weekly basis, and 98% use BBC1, we have made our choice, and its seems to work. We get relatively high quality stuff to watch and to listen to, with no adverts, on an 'all you can eat' basis. For 40p per household, per day. Can the market come up with a better offer - I doubt it. If we did slice and dice, for what are purely ideological reasons, I suspect, as the song says, we dont know what we've got til its gone.\nThe BBC gives us a mix of great TV, has a huge cultural reach, and keeps the rest honest.\nMikeB's 2,579 posts\nsentiment_satisfiedGold\nI think the best drama now comes from ITV\nIan's 497 posts\nPETER HUGHES\nThe licence fee equates to about 40 (forty) pence per day---less than a daily newspaper. For that we all receive ADVERT FREE Television AND Radio channels around the clock Listen to some of the programmes on BBC Radio 4----no commercial station would even consider covering this diverse range---why not? Because they have to keep THE ADVERTISERS HAPPY by delivering as a big an audience as possible.\nCurrently I am absolutely fed up with the Christmas adverts (Tesco one says \"It's Christma)) but I thought Christmas was on 25th December !!\nA friend, who spent some time in USA, on his return said he missed the BBC's full output across tv and radio---so there you have it..\nPETER HUGHES's 13 posts\nLorna Smith\nWe only have Freeview and happily pay the 40p or so that allows us to watch the BBC and any other available channels. As pensioners, who still pay for our licence, we would not like to be forced to pay more ... and if the BBC lost the licence, we would certainly have to pay far more and probably be able to access fewer channels.\nPeople over the channel can pick up the BBC and watch in preference to the own stations ... Think that suggests familiarity breeds contempt. The BBC is really an asset we cannot afford to lose.\nLorna Smith's 11 posts\nFred Perkins\nI think most would agree that the BBC is good value for the licence fee.\nBut as Martin Baines has put very well, We (and even more, the BBC), has forgotten its purpose. It has become selectively very 'commercial', and being the recipient of a huge amount of what is in effect a 'tax', is going far beyond its original remit.\nThe BBC is now competing heavily with commercial broadcasters which can and do achieve much of what the BBC chooses to dip its toes into, and without the constraints or disciplines of a commercial company, but able to distort the commercial market in ways which don't necessarily benefit the viewer. Almost by definition, the BBC's success in achieving its remit should NOT result in a quest for audience ratings - but it does so, because it can afford to do so. It is also stifling innovation in the creative industries, by virtue of its scale. It benefits from legally-enforced additional licence 'fees', index linked, and further supported by it providing 'free' licences to pensioners - which government 'pays' for, even though it doesn't cost the BBC a penny to provide the service to them. Smoke and mirrors!!\nThe BBC has substantially abandoned the part of its remit that is about 'educating' the public. It appears to be leading the 'dumbing down' of TV, rather than focusing on higher ideals.\nMost countries have a 'state broadcaster' - and nowadays that is mainly about producing news, which is expensive to do properly, and difficult for commercial broadcasters anyway.\nIncredibly, Ofcom doesn't even regulate the BBC as to whether it's biased - the BBC is its own judge and jury. That too, surely needs to be changed - all other broadcasters who broadcast news have to abide by Ofcom rules.\nArguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus.\nLet's just accept that the BBC must be provided with state funding for its core remit, but must be prevented from interfering in areas beyond that, either by cross-subsidy or excessive cash in its coffers to 'play' in other areas.\nFred Perkins's 13 posts\nFred Perkins: You've allowed youself to be seduced by an ideological viewpoint, rather than a practical one, even though you admit that the BBC is good value for money.\nIs the BBC actually 'crowding out' the commercial sector, and has it strayed from its original remit? If we take its original remit to be the Reithian \"inform, educate and entertain\", then the answer is no. Entertain means just that, and there is nothing wrong with the BBC producing programmes that we might actually want to watch and listen to. I'm sure there must have been people tutting that the BBC played light music and had comedy back in the 1930's, but we all seem to have survived. Think of all those classic BBC comedy programmes over the years - did that mean there were no decent comedies anywhere else on TV? Or drama?\nAs for crowding out, this is one of those free market bits of nonsense which pops up a lot, especially in the US. Thomas Frank basically has a whole chapter in 'The Wtecking Crew' devoted to shooting this meme down - pointing out that if you think 'guvment' is the problem, then anything it does well is bad, because government is bad. If the BBC is crowding out the private sector, then by that logic, so is the NHS, police, HM Revenue and the Army - all of which could be done by the private sector.\nIn reality, governemnt tends to help the private sector a great deal, as the book 'The Entreprenerial State' explains.\nThe BBC trains huge numbers of technicians, actors and directors. Think just how much drama the BBC makes each year - they are the single largest producer of drama on the planet - and then think what would happen if the BBC wasn't there. Brianist pointed out the results of such a report a while back - the conclusions were not good for the UK economy. And a huge amount of talent got their first break on the BBC. Anthony Mingella didn't start writing Oscar winners immediately - he started writing scripts for Grange Hill.\nIf the BBC was to produce only non commercial programmes, what would it look like?\nWe would perhaps have a 38 part series on the atonal composers from 1948-1982, documentaries on cheese making (just like National Lampoon's European Vacation), endless round table discussions on coastal erosion in Namibia and perhaps programmes on Mongolian throat singing. Possibly a film or two from the Swedish national film collection, showing the early works of a particularly gloomy director, obscure Scottish poets, and redubbed vintage Eastern Bloc animation (and a documentary on said animation). Cheap and very worthy children's prgrammes (here's bran, kids!), a series about the abandoned footwear found on Hadrian's Wall (actually, I would happily watch this), and an adaption of a famous 1923 Slovak play all about peasants, in the orginal Slovak. And dont forget the OU!\nOf course as soon as you put on this deeply high-brow stuff, the free-marketeers would immediately say that nobody watches this, and if they do, they should pay for it. Head they win, tails you lose.\nIn fact Sky was cheeky enough to try this argument some years ago about Eastenders - its popular, therefore commecial. In which case, it should be on Sky, which, although commercial, has produced remarkably few popular programmes.\nThe BBC has to supply a mixture, so as to inform, educate and entertain. Thats fine. I dont always want serious stuff. But, for those who think the BBC is dumbing down, this is the serious stuff from Radio 4 today. Thinking Allowed, Tweet of the Day, Start the Week (really good today), A Book of the Week about living in different houses, a drama about Syria, a documentary about horses on a housing estate. A History of Ideas, a series about the history of Mossad, an afternoon drama, a music quiz (with a lot of classical music), The Food Programme, a series about Scottish poets, Beyond Belief, a programme about the word Mongol(!), Crossing Continents, Shared Planet (about mangroves), The Book at Bedtime, and a programme about 'The Queen of African Music'. And of course Today, The World at One, PM, The World Tonight, and all the hourly news.\nAs for TV - have you seen BBC4? And there are some really good stuff on BBC3 - their Afghan programme is incrediably powerful.\n'Arguably, the BBC could achieve its remit with a budget a fraction (10%??) of the licence fee revenue - giving government something else on which to 'spend' the surplus. ' - Thats saloon bar handwaving. C5 has currently a £200m budget. Its makes bascially no content itself, buys its news in, and of course has no radio operation of any sort. And most of it is rubbish. You get what you pay for. BBC radio currently costs £650m - so almost double the £350m you suggest would cover everything. Your entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. Lets see the data behind your thinking.\nI think that the BBC makes a good case here - BBC - Blogs - About the BBC - Why the licence fee is the best way to fund the BBC\nWhat I find is that those who argue against the licence fee is that they have no workable alternative, and seem largely to have an ideological problem with it, rather than anything fundermentally practical.\n@MikeB: I don't want to get into a slanging match throwing insults at each other.\nI said that I respect the BBC. I'm a broadcaster myself, and have been for 11 years. I know what broadcasting costs, and haven't been 'seduced by an ideological viewpoint'.\nMy point is simply that much has changed since the Public Service Broadcasting remit of the BBC (and our other PSBs) was originally set up.\nAny single organisation handed close to £4 Billion a year by the state cannot fail to have an impact on its sector. We in the UK have one of the finest broadcasting regimes in the world, and the creative industries collectively contribute around 8% of our GDP.\nBriant Butterworth opened this thread with some valid reasoning for change. The last few years have seen immense disruption and change in 'television' in its many forms.\nThe BBC has no monopoly of truth nor of wisdom. Nor indeed do politicians. It must surely therefore be time for a re-examination of the BBC's role in what is a much wider canvas than could ever have been envisaged when it was set up. In most industries, the Competition Authorities worry about dominance of any single organisation over the sector.\nGeordie lad\nLorna Smith: Would that what you say about \"Advert Free\" was true; far from it! Program start and stop times are now disrupted by the Beeb's adverts for its own programs. As a retired broadcasting engineer, it was drummed into me at an early age that program schedule times MUST be adhered to, even if it meant using a stop watch and time signals.\nGeordie lad's 43 posts\nLorna Smith:"}

This is important as living and breathing in this city,\" COB chair Ashlee Davis said Monday. \"That's how important this is. That's not OK.\"\nThe board plans to issue a formal policy recommendation soon explaining their focus on transparency, as well as urging other departments to research possibly less expensive ways to store data and effectively use labor in processing video.\nThe board's executive team met Monday afternoon to assess a draft version of the recommendation they plan to issue to other stakeholders.\nThe board, which was established via a 2018 referendum approved by Nashville voters, is tasked with investigating allegations of police misconduct. The board also can recommend policy changes for the department.\nBody, dash cameras on hold\nA day after the board meeting, Mayor John Cooper announced plans to roll out a limited number of body cameras in 2020 while policy and cost questions are answered.\nThe city pulled back from a department-wide roll out last month amid a budget crisis and concerns over a mounting price tag.\nCooper's policy director John Buntin said it could cost more than $40 million per year to operate the cameras and analyze their footage, which he said was \"deeply concerning\" in the midst of a budget shortfall.\nThe delay has been tied to the state comptroller's urgent report to city leaders in November that Nashville was running out of money to pay its bills. The comptroller said officials must close a $41 million budget gap, or the state would take over the city's coffers.\nThe police department has about $10 million set aside to buy cameras, which have been a city priority since 2016. But city leaders have not decided how to handle millions in additional funds that could be needed as the body camera footage makes its way through the rest of the criminal justice system.\nDownstream costs could come from outside the mayor's office and MNPD; prosecutors and public defenders said they'll need funding to review thousands of hours of footage that becomes relevant in criminal cases.\nMonday's board meeting also included an update on the progress of the so-called Negotiation Task Force set up to allow representatives from the COB, mayor's office and MNPD to meet and negotiate the draft Memorandum of Understanding between the COB and MNPD.\nAlthough the COB representative to the task force, Phyllis Hildreth, was not present at the meeting, due to being out of town, board member Matthew Sweeney confirmed the task force is making progress on discussing the articles of the MOU.\nAlso not present Monday was the board staff's newly-appointed Executive Director Jill Fitcheard, who was tied up at another meeting, the board was informed.\nFitcheard was named the new director last week after the unexpected resignation of William Weeden, announced Nov. 18.\nDavis confirmed Monday that Fitcheard's salary would be updated to reflect her new position, effective as of the day last week she was named to the role.\n\"I have had a conversation with Director Fitcheard since our last meeting. I wanted to ensure she has all the support she needs,\" Davis said.\n\"Mrs. Fitcheard's commitment to the mission and purpose of the Community Oversight Board, and most importantly to the Nashville community, is unparalleled and her leadership has been instrumental to the success and continuity of the COB's efforts,\" Davis said in a statement last week. \"The COB congratulates her on this deserving appointment and looks forward to this continued work and progress with her as our Executive Director.\"\nIncludes reporting by Adam Tamburin.\nReach reporter Mariah Timms at mtimms@tennessean.com or 615-259-8344 and on Twitter @MariahTimms.\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2019/12/10/nashville-community-oversight-board-police-body-cameras/2633823001/\nLawsuit: Sumner schools failed to protect child sexually assaulted by classmate\nSenate passes anti-LGBT adoption bill\nNashville-to-Atlanta train service?

{"text": "By Christopher Musico, Contributor, CRM magazine\nFor the rest of the March 2009 issue of CRM magazine, please click here.\nThe notion of CRM may not have been specifically top-of-mind among the Founding Fathers as they congregated during the unbearably hot summer of 1776 to hammer out the Declaration of Independence. Even so, relationships between citizens and their representatives were precisely what those early patriots were helping to define, and the traditionally poor service the government has delivered in the two centuries since would have had many of them scratching their wigs.\nAccording to the latest scores from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), the federal government still lags behind the private sector when it comes to keeping people happy. This year, the feds scored a 68.9 out of a possible 100 points, while their commercial counterparts weighed in with a 75. The 68.9 score represented a 1.6 percent increase from last year, but the gap still remains. That turns out to be unsurprising, given rising consumer demands. \"Look at most enterprises today and you can [almost always] get 24/7 service,\" explains Ben Madgett, an analyst for New York–based research firm Datamonitor. \"There's an expectation there now that you should get the same from government.\"\nThe increasing expectations are also seen by Lisa Sherwin-Wulf, public-sector industry solutions manager for RightNow Technologies, a provider of on-demand customer experience solutions. Working with RightNow's 155 government-agency customers, there is growing pressure to increase operational efficiencies while at the same time ensuring that citizens can access any necessary information in their preferred channels. \"People are expecting things like timely response by chat, interactive voice response, email, and Web forums...something in addition to just walking into an office or calling on the telephone,\" she explains. \"The bar has definitely been raised.\"\nGovernment agencies on all levels, though, may have quite a bit of catching up to do. Ken Landoline, vice president of research for Reno, Nev.–based analyst firm Synergy Research Group, declares the public sector \"15 to 20 years behind the customer care contact center world.\" There is no doubt that many agencies are trying to improve their service offerings, but with a looming economic recession, less money to invest, and an ever-increasing population, will governments be able to catch up or just continue to run in place in the effort to provide citizen service? CRM takes a look at some agencies making the investment, amid others continuing to languish under the premise of \"business as usual.\"\nMadgett points to the e-government initiative that started approximately a decade ago as the moment when agencies determined they needed to bolster service to match what consumers were increasingly expecting from their retailers and other commercial engagements. \"Certainly in the last five years there has been more of an uptake in this initiative,\" he says. \"Governments are starting to realize what's out there and take advantage of using the Internet at its most basic level to provide service.\"\nThis can be seen as a win-win situation for many agencies, as technological innovations allow them to not only optimize their own processes but also cater to an increasingly Internet-fluent constituency. \"Local government offices started to progress to online payments such as filing taxes,\" Madgett says. \"As that relationship has evolved, [agencies are] now looking for something to manage that process—hence CRM—and so it's about providing that level of service and then cracking it as well with analytics to find out how many people are paying online, the issues they're having, and how agencies can help [provide a resolution].\"\nWhen it comes to CRM vendors able to hit the ground running with government outlets, Madgett points to typical big-name players including Oracle and SAP, but says others in the CRM world can cater to specific needs of different agencies on all levels. \"You also have RightNow, Consona, and other smaller players who can hit more certain geographical markets, local government, and processes specific to them,\" he says.\nSince government has been slower to adopt CRM, it has made many organizations loathe to stray from on-premises deployments to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Madgett's research finds there are more on-premises deployments in government than on-demand ones at this point—but that may start to change. \"There are some [chief information officers] out there who have encouraged agencies to look more toward SaaS,\" he says. \"There's a lot of possibility there. We're not totally there yet, but there's certainly a movement [developing].... We're cautiously optimistic.\"\nRightNow's Sherwin-Wulf says the movement's already arrived, with most of the 150 government agencies on her company's client list having already gone with SaaS, thanks to its lower costs, speed of deployment, and scalability. She reports that many of her company's customers decide to focus on the channel which will have the most significant impact first—generally Web self-service. After that, the customer can scale up as usage grows—similar to how the private sector does it. \"Government agencies need to deal with these rising challenges in a timely manner,\" she says. \"So they are becoming much more comfortable with that.\"\nCRM ROADBLOCKS\nSo if government agencies are starting to grow more comfortable with deploying CRM to gain a more comprehensive view of the customer, then why haven't they all caught on? Madgett says there are several reasons: legal, operational, and cultural. It can start with terminology. \"A lot of what we're talking about here is customer service, and the private sector–driven mentality to things,\" he says. \"In the government space, there is a [reluctance] to refer to the citizen as a customer, and that mindset has to go away. You have to be comfortable with thinking of your citizens as customers, even if you don't call them that.\"\nMadgett also says it gets back to barriers traditionally set up in government agencies sensitive to data they've been charged to collect and maintain. He explains that sharing information across agencies—for example, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense—is not necessarily a given. This runs counter to the traditional argument that CRM provides a 360-degree view of the customer (or in government's case, the constituent). There are also some restrictions on sharing private, sensitive data among different funnels. Add that to the siloed nature of many offices, and even when it's legal to share information, many will not come together, regardless of whether they're local, state, or federal. \"There's a challenge there because there is tension between creating a comprehensive view and avoiding 'Big Brother,' \" Madgett says.\nMadgett says that, generally speaking, the government culture is already a slow adopter of technology. Implementing a CRM system at all can be an issue: At heart, CRM is a strategic solution before a technological one. To Madgett, it doesn't matter whether you're a government agency or a retail chain, recklessly adding new capabilities without first thinking about business benefits can lead to a doomed implementation. \"You need someone who [understands] to champion this like [New York City Mayor Michael] Bloomberg with the 311 system,\" he says, referring to the city's citizen-information call-in number. \"You can't just implement a call center or throw in a CRM system. You have to know your end goal and take the proper steps to figure out how to best allocate resources based on that.\" (See the NYC 311 chart, at right.)\nDIAL 311 FOR EVOLUTION\nFew cities have a larger constituency than New York City does. Boasting a population of more than 8 million people, the city decided back in 2002 to create a phone line for those living—and visiting—The Big Apple to be able to call for quick information. The service has never looked back since going live in 2003. \"This is a great example of a concrete application of CRM,\" Madgett proclaims. \"At 3 a.m., you can still call up 311 if you have a noise complaint, if something is wrong, there's a leak in your apartment...you can find out instantaneously. This is the type of service we have come to expect.\"\nWhile the system has been deemed a success so far, that doesn't mean it hasn't had to make some adjustments, according to Joe Morrisroe, the deputy commissioner and executive director of 311 and www.nyc.gov, the city's official Web site. There have been many lessons learned during the continual efforts at service improvement, Morrisroe says. One maxim was to prepare ahead of time depending on the particular season. In the winter months, he explains, 311 puts information at the beginning of the interactive voice response (IVR) recording about guidelines concerning heat and hot-water complaints. \"It's a way of educating the populace,\" he says.\nMorrisroe says that pushing information to the beginning of the IVR allows callers to either ignore the message if it doesn't apply to them, or avoid having to wait for a representative to take the call. He admits call spikes can put a strain on the 311 system, but insists the city doesn't blindly rely upon the IVR—there are other safeguards in place to avoid a backlog of calls, he says. \"We're staffed very well to ensure calls are answered quickly,\" he says. \"We have organic growth in our call center; a lot of people in staff support—be it supervisors or team leaders—are former call-takers or have that skill set. We can mobilize people quickly and put them on the phones if necessary to help with the volume.\"\nThis can come into play as the economic recession threatens to freeze or cut the budgets of many government agencies. While it is not yet clear if the 311 system will be affected, Morrisroe says he's already taking safeguards to maintain high service quality. \"The goal we have is not a lower-cost channel, but more of a self-service channel that can yield lower cost results,\" he says.\nHe explains that after being open for business the past five years, there is plenty of robust content that can be available to the populace via the IVR and Web in order to lessen the barrage of calls for live agents.\n\"We have answers to virtually any question someone in New York may have, and it is vetted by our organization as well as the requisite city agencies,\" Morrisroe says. \"That's one of our main goals—and the economic pressure helps facilitate that a bit more: to push more information into the IVR and Web than we did in the past.\"\nFor Morrisroe, this is all in pursuit of the organization's mission. \"Customer service is public service in action,\" he says. \"That's a motto we carry with us.\"\nROCKY MOUNTAIN SELF-SERVICE\nRo Silva, public information and education manager in the taxpayer service division of the Colorado Department of Revenue (CODR), could be deemed a visionary for her time. Back in 1995, her agency began accepting email from stressed-out individuals who needed to send questions about tax inquiries without clogging the phone lines. \"We were answering these [using] Microsoft Outlook,\" she recalls. \"In 2000, we were getting and answering 14,000 emails a year, which was a lot for that time. I knew it was going to evolve into asking the same questions over and over again.\"\nShe turned to RightNow Technologies to create a Web self-service channel. Now, Colorado residents with questions come tax season can go to the department's Web site and look for answers before trying to email or call. In fact, Silva says, the system is set up so that Web-site visitors have to check out the \"frequently asked questions\" before being able to access the CODR email interface. Of course, that doesn't prevent residents from calling immediately. \"People can make a phone call because those numbers are listed on our homepage, telephone book,\" she insists. \"You can call us no matter what.\"\nAs a result of utilizing SaaS for its Web self-service, Silva was able to boost CODR's productivity, satisfaction, and cost-efficiency. The department has realized a return on investment of 8,732 percent, email volume has dropped by 45 percent, and the unit saved $700,000 over an 18-month period. And that doesn't even account for the peace of mind many residents have now when they can either find an answer quickly online, or be able to get through quickly to an agent with a more-complex question. \"Our wait times are pretty good for a government agency.... They are about four minutes,\" she says. \"Before RightNow, during peak season people waited for 20 minutes to speak with a tax representative.\"\nWhile there are no plans to innovate further with RightNow at this time, Silva says that it lays the groundwork for what could be an extra-difficult season, with the recession hitting the state of Colorado particularly hard—a hiring freeze on all state employees started in October 2008. \"We're not able to hire any new [employees], which works against us even though we have all these great services people can self-service through,\" she says. \"It's going to hurt because...you still have people who have specific issues that need to be addressed, and it might mean they may not be able to get through as quickly.\"\nSilva remains thankful that she has RightNow's system in place. Otherwise, they would have to shut down the email channel just to alleviate the pressure placed on the agents. \"We just wouldn't be able to get to it all,\" she says.\nGOVERNMENT 2.0—NEXT ON THE AGENDA?\nThe 800-pound gorilla in the room comes in the form of Web 2.0 technologies, including blogs, chat, forums, social networking sites, Twitter, and wikis. Filtering into the CRM world via the private sector, this is the next opportunity for innovation, according to Madgett. But, just as with traditional CRM deployments, strategy must be in place first. \"Governments are slow to adopt, and especially with something like Web 2.0—where you get into using utilities like Twitter—they are experimenting with it but haven't captured what they want to do with it yet,\" he says. \"It's good to adopt the technology but without a strategic framework the practical usage of it can be lost.\" (See this month's \"CRM on Twitter,\" page 16, for a quick snapshot of some government twitterers.)\nKaren Trebon, a program analyst with the General Services Administration's Office of Citizen Services, cites a plethora of examples of agencies at all levels starting to adopt varying forms of Web 2.0 technology to help inform and interact with their respective constituents. The examples run all the way to the top: With President Barack Obama in the White House now, she expects government to delve even deeper. From the Obama campaign's Web site to the transition team's efforts with www.change.gov to its revitalized www.whitehouse.gov, community participation clearly ranks high on the national public-policy scene. \"One of the things that is driving this and will continue to [do so] is Obama coming into office,\" she says. \"I think everybody can agree that he outclassed [Senator John] McCain in the use of the Web and technology. For the first time, I think we'll have a president...who is just as smart as all of us about technology.\"\nBeyond Obama's potential, Trebon admits she also feels the heat from constituents demanding equality in the service they receive from both the public and private sectors. \"People love Amazon.com and they expect to go on our Web site and love it just as much,\" she says. \"We don't get allowances for being the government, so we have to keep up with what people want on the Web.\"\nBy Trebon's count, there are 37 active, public-facing, federal agency blogs right now, plus an untold number of efforts at the lower levels of government. \"[Blogging] seems to be the most adopted form of Web 2.0 at this time,\" she says. \"But a lot of these technologies are free or low-cost, so there is no worry about ROI or going and asking anyone for money.\"\nSo if that's the case, why aren't more agencies picking up on Web 2.0? She believes it has to do with bandwidth concerns, potential viruses, and actionable strategy. \"I spoke with representatives from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and they deal with very serious information including the [number] of people who are incarcerated and on death row...and they're not sure how to take this information and use it on something like Facebook,\" she says. \"To them, [that context] seems very lighthearted.\"\nWhile that may be an extreme case, Trebon points to several instances in which using Web 2.0 can serve the people well. The bloggers at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) determined through blog comments that passengers were experiencing different rules at different airports, making unclear what rules were optional and which were absolutely mandatory, such as removing shoes before going through security. \"[The TSA] actually used that information to tighten up the mandate across the country,\" she says. \"That's an example of how Web 2.0 can actually achieve results. The TSA didn't just take comments from people on the Web, but actually made a process improvement.\"\nLike blogs, Trebon says Twitter can also provide an opportunity to continue a dialogue with constituents, particularly during times of crisis. \"We used it here in our office during the Mumbai incident,\" she says, referring to the December 2008 terrorist attacks. \"People can follow our tweets to keep up to date on what's going on, where and how to call if you have family or friends in an area that's being affected by some form of calamity.\"\nWhile still in its nascent stages, Government 2.0 has the potential to not only increase citizen satisfaction, but to offer a sense of transparency and, as a consequence, trust—a trait that's sometimes lacking but always essential to the democratic process. \"The Obama team has been talking to us a lot about transparency and just putting more information out there,\" Trebon says. \"The interactive nature of these technologies increases trust in government and makes people feel like they're being listened to because we're responding back to them.\"\nSIDEBAR: 2 Tips to Contact Center Implementation Bliss\nGary Peckham, director of the contact center for the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Service, knows a thing or two about quickly revamping a contact center to adjust to a quick mandate. Back in 2000, his department was charged with providing landlord and tenant issues to an additional 800,000 Calgary citizens when the city decided to cease offering the services on its own. Peckham had four months to make it happen, and he says he turned to Avaya to \"bring us into the new century.\"\nLooking back at the pain of the initial implementation, he has a couple of tips for government agencies now looking to revamp their contact centers:\nMake sure you listen to your employees. \"We spent a lot of time dealing with Avaya's staff and making sure that we were understanding of them,\" he recalls. \"However, we didn't spend enough time explaining to our workers why things had to happen in a certain sequence.\"\nWeigh all the purchasing options, even if you don't want to \"reinvent the wheel.\" \"Government's mindset isn't necessarily the same as private business where you're always upgrading on an ongoing basis,\" he explains. \"When we purchase a product we anticipate that it will last a certain period of time. Consistent upgrades are not built into the budget process. Had we leased the product, we could have had an easier time when we had to keep up with the changing times. We needed to look at other options and how that would have been beneficial to the taxpayer in the long haul.\"\nSIDEBAR: NYC 311: Call Volumes, Performance Levels, and Resolutions\nAgency Transfer or Referral: Caller is transferred to the appropriate agency or is referred to and provided with the appropriate agency's telephone number.\nInformation Provided: Caller has been provided with all of the requested information for their specific inquiry and no further action is required.\nService Request: Caller's request is entered into the City's Citizen Service Center tracking system and the request is forwarded to the appropriate agency for completion.\nTransfer to 911: Call is deemed an emergency, a crime in progress, or a Police Department 911 matter and is immediately transferred to 911.\nOther: Calls to follow-up on an existing service request or those that are not completed prior to the caller disconnection are classified as other.\nSource: www.nyc.gov; Mayor's Office of Operations\nPerformance Measure Performance Goal Fiscal 2009 Year-to-Date November 2008\nTotal Incoming Calls * 6,837,442 1,465,016\nAverage Weekday Call Volume * 53,049 60,816\nAverage Wait Time 30 seconds 7 seconds 6 seconds\n% of Calls Answered within 30 seconds 90% 94% 95%\n% of Language-Assisted Calls * 2.1%\n* No performance goal available\nAssistant Editor Christopher Musico can be reached at cmusico@destinationCRM.com.\nEvery month, CRM magazine covers the customer relationship management industry and beyond.

USA came into the final defeating England 2-1 whereas Netherlands entered the final courtesy a 1-0 win over Sweden.\nPreview, prediction, schedule\nThe three-time world champions USA are coming into the final riding high on a hard fought win against England. They have been in magnificent form throughout the tournament and have not lost a single match. However, their star player and probably the player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe was out of the semi-final clash due to a hamstring injury. But the USA team management have announced that she will be fit for the final. The loss of such a big player would have been a major setback for the team. With her in the team, they will be looking forward to adding another trophy to their collection.\nOn the other hand, Netherlands who are now oozing with confidence after qualifying for the final, came into the cup decider by beating Sweden in a hard fought 1-0 win. The sole goal of the match came in the 99th minute. The 2017 European champions will be hoping that their star player Lieke Martens performs up to her usual high standard and gets fit for the final. She was one of the reasons behind the 2017 triumph so her presence will be very vital for the Orange Brigade.\nThe USA definitely have the upper hand over first time finalist Netherlands and are, definitely, the favourite to win. But Netherlands, who have been unbeaten for the last 12 matches, will not let them win easily.

{"text": "World War I Has Lessons for Today\nWorld War I began with the smallest of incidents and turned into one of the most complex of global events, a lesson that should be heeded today, according to a panel of historians gathered at the Association of the U.S. Army on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into \"the war to end all wars.\"\nIn 1914, the world was stable when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated in Bosnia. That \"small event\" launched the great war in Europe, said Michael S. Neiberg, chair of war studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College. And once war begins, \"it can be virtually impossible to get out.\"\nIt took several years for the U.S. to agree to join the war, with politics playing a major role in that hesitation, Neiberg said. Once Congress agreed to enter the war on April 6, 1917, the U.S. military was unable to deploy quickly and took a year to be effective in Europe, he said.\nAmong the myths of the war is that the U.S. Army resisted working under French and British command, said Edward Lengel, chief historian of the White House Historical Association. In fact, \"amalgamation\" was happening by November 1917, \"but the collaboration was not an easy one,\" he said.\nThe U.S. Army proved to be exceptionally adaptable as the war went on, he said.\nThe April 6 discussion was co-hosted by AUSA and the Center for Military Diplomatic History, which promotes the application of history to contemporary problems.\nAusa Twitter\nTweets by AUSAorg\nSoldier Tests Speed Fielding of New Equipment\nMcPherson: Army Will Make Recruiting Goal This Year\nThe George Washington Chapter AUSA 2020 Scholarship Program\nAUSA VP for Veteran Affairs Raises $$$$ for Fisher House Charleston\nFuture Army Contributions to Space Force Discussed\nMcCarthy Seeks to Delay Military Hospital Merger\nMcConville: Army Must Innovate to Succeed\nArmy Expands Presence, Partnerships in Indo-Pacific\nLeaders Committed to Housing Improvements\nLab Highlights Science, Tech Advances"}

The new graphics are fantastic, and the game has a nifty hotkey (It was F10 for me on PC) that takes you back and forth from new graphics to old 1990's gameplay. There are lots of major upgrades, like a re-done soundtrack and voice acting added to the new game.\nAs far as graphics go, I'm really happy with the way it was done. The game looked like a painting most of the time, and it kept with the same feel that I remember when I played this more than 10 years ago on MSDOS. A lot of things were also added, such as random skulls in the sky forming clouds and what not, but it didn't take away from the overall feel of it, because it's got the same art style we saw in Monkey Island 3: Curse of Monkey Island.\nI know I've said it before, I find these Monkey Island games to be absolutely hilarious, and I'm very happy to see that LucasArts is bringing back the first 2 in the best way. It felt like I was playing the game for the first time again. The best part was, if I needed to remember something the old way, there was the hotkey. Another point, Monkey Island games have been cross-platform for a while, but I'll mention it here anyway: The Special Editions are cross-platform! Now you can play them via PSN, PC..even your iPhone.\nI strongly recommend anyone reading this that enjoys a fun puzzle game every now and then to at least download the demo's available for these new games!\nJuly 21, 2010 | Categories: gaming, PC, PS3, Reviews | Tags: Funny, LucasArts, monkey island, Puzzle Games, RPG, Special Edition | 2 Comments"}

A first in the history of the Atlas Lions who eliminated Spain after a penalty shootout completely missed by La Roja (0-0, 3-0 on pens).\nMoroccans could have had big regrets after the three big opportunities harvested by Walid Cheddira (see elsewhere) at the end of the game but they finally succeeded better in their shots on goal than the Spaniards. If Badr Benoun, third shooter, missed his attempt, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Hakim Ziyech and especially Achraf Hakimi – who managed a daring Panenka – allowed Morocco to join the next round. On the Spanish side, neither Pablo Sarabia, nor Carlos Soler, nor Sergio Busquets managed to deceive Yassine Bounou, the Moroccan goalkeeper, who stopped two out of three shots, the first failing on the post.\nDominant throughout the game (76.8% ball possession), Spain never knew how to be effective. Luis Enrique's men had to wait until the 54th minute to target their first shot, a shot from Olmo deflected by Bounou. The Moroccans defended courageously and intelligently, trying to take advantage of Spain's losses to launch counterattacks. They could have cracked at the end of extra time, but success was on their side even if they lost Nayef Aguerd to injury (85th) and their captain Romain Saïss, hit in the left thigh, finished on one leg. Canada scorer (2-1) and some Belgium (2-0) in the previous round, Morocco, which conceded only one goal in four matches, will face the winner of Portugal-Switzerland (this Tuesday, 8 p.m.) to try to integrate the last four.\nThe player: Cheddira, missed opportunities\nComing in the 82nd minute in place of Selim Amallah, Walid Cheddira had several chances to open the scoring for Morocco. First there was this pivot shot too soft to deceive Unai Simon (86th). He was then caught by Aymeric Laporte in the Spanish area when he had been perfectly launched by Sofyan Amrabat (94th) at the start of extra time. Found by Ounahi, he lost a new duel against Simon (104th) before being taken over by Rodri in the area when Amrabat had still ideally launched him (115th).\nThe fact: Sarabia, the failed entry\nIn the 118th minute, Luis Enrique made the bet to replace Nico Williams – who came on in the 76th minute in place of the mediocre Ferran Torres – to start Pablo Sarabia for the penalty shootout. During his half hour spent on the lawn, Williams had nevertheless shown desire and beautiful things with the ball at his feet. After finding the post at the very end of extra time following a cross from Pedri (120th + 3), the PSG striker presented himself as the first Spanish shooter during the penalty shootout and again hit the post.\nMorocco is the 4th African team to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010.

{"text": "There comes a time in any hobbyist or lifestyle enthusiast's life when he or she reaches a crossroads.\nThe decision has to be made whether or not his or her existing level of engagement – as in how much money they're willing to throw at it – is good enough to keep them happy.\nIf the answer is \"no\" then that person will continue to enjoy their pursuit much the same as always. But, if the answer is \"yes\" then that usually means it's time for an equipment upgrade.\nIf you're an occasional griller, then a Kamado Joe is probably a significant upgrade versus what you're using now. It's certainly going to be a departure from your usual backyard cookouts.\nBy the end of this article, you will know if you're a \"yes\" or a \"no\" person, though we think you're in the \"yes\" camp if you find yourself here reading this.\nWhat is the Kamado Joe Classic II?\nWhy Do People Choose the Kamado Joe Classic II?\nShould You Buy the Kamado Joe Classic II?\nKamado grills are very different in appearance and functionality from a standard grill.\nThe basic form of the Kamado has been around for thousands of years but only came to the Western world in the mid-20th century. Even then it was a few decades before they really started to take off in popularity.\nToday, Kamados are somewhere between mainstream and cultish, and you'd be forgiven for having never seen one in person.\nThe Classic II is one of several ceramic kamados produced by Kamado Joe, and it's the one with the broadest appeal.\nIt's a reasonably sized smoker and grill that will fit in most backyard spaces. Unlike some 2-in-1 units, a kamado can achieve temperatures high enough to sear, but can also hold a low enough temperature for true low 'n' slow grilling.\nOne company, Big Green Egg, largely dominated the kamado industry for many years. Kamado Joe offered the first serious threat to BGE's dominance.\nIn recent years, Kamado Joe has been at the forefront of innovation and invention when it comes to kamado grilling. They have an ever-expanding product line, with a few new gems in the works and due for imminent release.\nCustomer support is second to none, the owner of the company himself, Bobby Brennan, is active on social media and very customer facing. They are a well-respected company, who stand by their products and have a vast community of fans surrounding them.\nLet's take a very close look at the Kamado Joe Classic, the medium sized grill in a family of three comprising of the Junior, Classic and Big Joe.\nThe 'Classic' is by far the most popular of the three sizes available, and while the much smaller junior has noticeable differences, almost everything said below can be applied to the larger Big Joe version, with the exception of dimensions and cooking capacity.\nAnd for the record, of all the Kamados we've looked at, the KJ Classic is our absolute favorite and took top spot in our roundup of the best kamado grills for 2018.\nIt's very well packaged, and everything you need to get grilling except the fuel.\nThe first impression you'll get is this is a very well packed box, which is a good thing since ceramic is somewhat fragile. Assembly is pretty straightforward, and you'll be up and running in no time.\nThe Kamado Joe Classic II is an attractive grill; the glossy red exterior is a real eye-catcher! It's also pretty darn hefty so make sure you have an able-bodied assistant to help you put it together.\nBuild-quality is excellent; all connecting parts are solidly attached, everything fits snugly, and the lid latches closed and stays tightly sealed. The whole unit feels very well thought out and user-friendly.\nThe two side tables are such a blessing when you've got a bunch of tools, sauces, and seasonings all vying for space. The thermometer is front and center, and the top vent and bottom ash drawer are all easy to get at.\nKJ has established itself as a leader in the kamado and grilling industry.\nThere is a lot of respect for the company and its products; very few Kamado Joe owners give up their grills out of disappointment.\nThey also have a reputation for high-quality, well-built kamados, that produce amazing results, and there's a vibrant community of owners out there.\n18\" diameter cooking area / 256 sq. in.\nThe top vent on a kamado performs the critical function of controlling airflow (in conjunction with the bottom vent) and allowing smoke to escape the chamber.\nControlling the airflow helps regulate the temperature inside, which is especially important when you're cooking low 'n' slow.\nIndicator markers help you set your opening with precision, and find that same spot the next time so you can quickly dial into required temps.\nThe vent is also well designed to keep rain and snow out of the interior and making a royal mess of your grill.\nHaving an 18\" diameter grill should be limiting, but the clever engineers at Kamado Joe have found ways to max out on versatility.\nWith their novel grill system, you can set up grills at staggered heights and use heat deflectors to create distinct temperature zones, and areas for direct and indirect grilling simultaneously. This is something you might think only possible with a standard-shaped barbeque.\nCleaning out ash is a dirty job, but every charcoal or wood-fired grill owner has to deal with it at some point. To help ease the burden, the Classic II has an ash collection area at the bottom of the unit.\nAll you have to do is slide out the drawer and carefully dispose of the contents. Of course, not all the ash will cooperate, so they do include a handy ash clean-out tool for those hard-to-reach places.\nIf you read the specs, you know the Classic II weighs 188 lbs. As you might imagine, the lid is a substantial part of this, is very heavy and could be quite a chore to open and close.\nFortunately, the Air Lift hinge takes almost all the effort out of operating the lid.\nNot only can you lift it with ease using only a finger or two, but it will also stay open at any position you choose. No more worries about cracked lids!\nYeah, I am personally obsessed with side tables. I love having work/storage space, but without devoting a ton of room to a large table, cart, stand, or storage unit.\nThere's just the right amount of room for a plate to receive cooked food, or for rubs, seasonings, and sauces to wait their turn. It's nice to be able to set down my frosty beverage, too.\nSpeaking of lids, a tight fit is essential to good low 'n' slow cooking. You don't want to lose smoke and heat because you forgot to check if the lid was shut, especially since the lid won't self-close.\nWith the rust-resistant latch, there's no guessing whether or not the lid is down.\nNow that we've gone over the numbers and features let's take a look at some of the other factors worth considering when you're buying any kind of grill or smoker, and how the Kamado Joe measures up.\nBeing versatile is not the same as being easy. There's a lot you can do with a Kamado, but if you're used to more conventional grilling, there is going to be a learning period while you master all the nuances of the equipment.\nBy the way, this is a kamado thing, not a specifically Kamado Joe thing.\nIf you're already used to grilling with charcoal, you're going to have an easier time adapting than someone switching over from gas, of course.\nStill, there may be some frustration at first as you learn to control the temperature for long roasts and smokes. Once you've got the hang of it, though, you'll love it.\nCleaning your Kamado Joe is pretty straightforward. We've already gone over the ash drawer and ash-cleaning tool. If you keep the cooker covered between uses, there won't be much else to do.\nLike most indoor ovens, a kamado can self-clean. The manufacturer suggests getting the temperature up to 600F for 15 minutes. At that point, close off the vents and wait for the kamado to cool down completely. Then simply brush off of the grate and ceramics, and that's all that's necessary.\nKamado Joe builds an excellent cooker, but even the best can have an off day. They have a good reputation for providing quick and useful support, and most customers come away happy after an interaction.\nYou can phone KJ toll-free, but the best access to support seems to be through an online form. You can even attach a picture of your issue to the form with ease. Socially, they maintain Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter accounts. They have a tab on their website for 'Community,' but as of the time of writing, this section was non-functional.\nTo interact with other Kamado Joe users, your best bet is to try Facebook. There are groups for fans in many specific geographical locations (such as Australia/New Zealand, U.K., Sweden, and The Netherlands), as well as a general group open to all. This last group boasts more than 14,000 members, and there are daily posts. You can check out this group here.\nAllow it to come up to temp slowly with the bottom vent just a couple of inches open, and the top daisy wheel fully open. When 20 degrees or so from target temp, close down the top vent to 1/4 open and allow the temp to slowly, slowly rise. If you overshoot, coming back down is hard.\nFor high temp searing, use fresh charcoal. For low n slow cooking, you can reuse unspent fuel from previous cooks.\nInvest in the grill expander and really load up your grill for each cook. You have to invest time into cooking, and money into quality charcoal, so get the most out of each cook to smoke multiple meals worth of food. You can always refrigerate or freeze smoked food to reheat later.\nDon't be afraid to experiment – with the right gear, you can bake in a kamado, and even produce authentic pizza!\nThere is no question that the Classic II is a terrific grill and smoker. While you'll never be able to ram an entire side of beef into it, it's big enough to handle most typical smoking and grilling assignments, including large brisket.\nAnd, in terms of build quality, it's hard to beat a Kamado Joe.\nIf you're excited by the idea of such versatility, you appreciate high-quality products, and maybe you're just a little enamored of the prestige (not everyone has such a fine grill!) then this investment will reward you with many, many years of enjoyment.\nAlthough this is a great grill, there may be reasons why it isn't the one for you. Here are a few alternate suggestions for you to consider.\nIf your biggest issue with the Classic II is the size, you've got options. For example, if you want an even larger kamado for truly epic cookouts, the Big Joe might be the one for you. It has a 24\" diameter grill, and, just like the Classic II, it is divisible and expandable.\nYou can get a load of this beast, with specs, images and current prices on amazon right here.\nNow, if your problem with the Classic II is that it's too big, and you want a compact kamado you can take with you, you could choose the Joe Jr. With a 13.5\" diameter grill, and weighing \"only\" 68 pounds, you have the option of going mobile.\nYou can learn more about this cute little kamado by clicking this link to the Junior Joe on amazon.\nIf the idea of kamado cooking appeals, but the price tag of the Classic II doesn't, there are other kamados to try.\nOne of the most popular is the Broil King Keg 5000. While I wouldn't call it \"inexpensive,\" it is certainly more economical than many other kamados. It may not have the cachet of a Kamado Joe, or a Big Green Egg, but it will provide a good grilling experience for less money. And, it looks like a keg of beer.\nIf you want to tap the keg, check it out on amazon here.\nPerhaps you're sold on the 2-in-1 concept, but you feel a bit intimidated by charcoal and don't want to take the time to learn. (Hey maybe you just don't have the time!) In that case, a pellet grill might scratch that itch.\nThe SmokePro DLX automatically feeds enough wood pellets into the firebox to reach and hold the temperature you set on the electronic control. It's user-friendly and gives great results. Just be aware that it has a lower maximum temperature than a kamado, so it cannot sear.\nWe've got a full review of the SmokePro DLX you can peruse <insert internal link here>.\nOr You can skip right to the specs and details on amazon at this link.\nEvery time we look at a Kamado Joe grill, we come away impressed. It really is a fun and versatile product, and anyone passionate about barbecue is going to have a great experience with one of these babies.\nNo, they don't pay us to say this stuff – we just love these grills! I (Mark) still have my original Classic version 1, and should be adding a version 2 sometime this year. I love them that much.\nIf you're feeling the love (or you're wondering why we are) you should take a minute or two to check further details at amazon.\nDon't forget to send us your questions, comments, critiques and more in the comment section below.\nIt's been great sharing this time with you, and we look forward to seeing you around the site!"}
{"text": "Gucci, Cartier, Prada, Chanel and Louis Vuitton may still dominate fashion in China – but the new 'Made in China' tag is winning the hearts of local millennials\nItamar Manes\nDavid Sylvia by Hao Weimin, spring/summer 2020 collection. Photo: Hao Weimin\nThis post originally appeared on South China Morning Post\nWhether it's a love for Gucci Padlock handbags, puckering up with Hermès lipsticks or enjoying splurges at Cartier, Chinese consumers are continuing to power the global luxury market. The love of luxe in China has been one of the most visible features of the nation's unprecedented development this century. While a mere three decades ago luxury brands were out of reach for the vast majority of the population, today Chinese consumers make up almost half of global luxury retail sales.\nThis enormous increase is unsurprising given the tremendous growth of the middle class and China's burgeoning elite. But as we enter a new decade, it's no longer enough to buy, buy, buy: a new generation of Chinese fashion insiders wants to dominate the other side of the equation and focus on design.\nDutch Chinese designer Hu Sheguang creates unique couture fashion featuring Jean Paul Gaultier-style whimsy fused with sumptuous Chinese fabrics and artisanship, while David Sylvia by Hao Weimin modernises traditional Peking Opera for his new collections. Other brands like Heaven Gaia by Xiong Ying have followed the heels of couturier Guo Pei onto the stage of Paris Couture Week.\nAn outfit from Chinese designer Yueqi Qi's spring/summer 2020 collection. Photo: Yueqi Qi\nToday, luxury consumption remains uncertain in the face of the havoc caused by the coronavirus to the national and global economy. With the international fashion calendar on hold, China Fashion Week, which took place in early May, was one of a handful of industry events since the coronavirus outbreak. A combination of live-streamed and physical events, it put the spotlight on local Chinese talent including L'arôme, Jumper Zhang and Young X.\nDespite the emergence of so much talent, the main challenge for the China fashion world is dealing with three simple words that for decades have meant inferior rather than fashion-forward: \"Made in China\".\nIn fact, the term Made in China – with all its negative connotations – does not communicate the full picture. Most European fashion brands have a major component (if not all) of their production done in China, proving that quality is not necessarily as compromised as commonly thought. While there may be some subpar production facilities across the nation, China also offers some of the most advanced and dynamic textile factories available in the world.\nIf there is no lack of innovation, talent and facilities within the country, what is it exactly that fuels Chinese consumers' love affair with foreign brands? Most of these consumers, who are estimated to spend on average 180 per cent more on fashion from abroad than home-grown brands, will be well-aware that a lot of international branded goods are produced in China.\nHeaven Gaia by Xiong Ying, an elegant take on traditional motifs. Photo: Heaven Gaia\nChina-born, Central Saint Martin-educated designer Yueqi Qi was trained at the ateliers of Chanel and Givenchy before returning to her homeland to establish her own brand in 2019. Her collection channels beading designs handmade in China.\n\"I'm confident that the new generation can reinvent the reputation of 'Made in China' as a pool of talent like Samuel Guì Yang and myself have learned the skills overseas, and we have faith in what we make,\" Qi explains. \"Customers usually don't look at where the product is made but focus on the items overall. Other factors like sustainability could be a decisive factor instead,\" she adds.\nLuxury consumerism in China is still undergoing a huge transformation, and is yet to be truly defined. To put things in perspective, over half of today's high-net-worth individuals in China were not of that status five years ago. This has been a common pattern over the past three decades and one that continues to grow. According to research institute McKinsey & Company, this is good news for Chinese designers as local consumers are open to new things as their status and wealth increases.\nChinese designers are not lacking the knowledge and skills it takes to create desirable products, with many, like Qi, having studied or worked for prestigious design schools worldwide. The realisation that a focus on creativity is a better remedy for gaining widespread acclaim rather than focusing on short-term commercial success, is beginning to take root. What could be an even more important step towards creating an authentic connection is to fully embrace the Made in China tag.\nBack in 2014, some Chinese designers found a creative way of doing exactly that, by labelling their products as \"Proudly Made in China\". Designers such as Guo Pei, Xander Zhou and Samuel Guì Yang have moulded entire collections, and even careers, in an effort to convey this message, and have achieved global success as a result.\nGuo Pei's traditional bridal dress took five years to make using pure gold embroidery thread. Photo: Guo Pei\nAlongside this creative success, given that nationwide Chinese patriotism is on the rise, it's likely that young consumers will likely feel increasingly positive towards local brands.\nAs for China's Gen-Z nouveau riche, this hope is already a reality. AliResearch, a research institution by Alibaba (which owns the South China Morning Post) found in its Chinese consumer brands research for 2020 that Chinese brands predominate among buyers; for \"post-95\" consumers, the brands in their shopping trolleys tend to be Huawei and Xiaomi rather than Apple or Nike.\nElsbeth van Paridon, a fashion and urban culture journalist, and founder of The China Temper explains how the \"ad nauseam prejudgments\" about the Made in China label are \"undergoing the ultimate 21st century makeover – with a subversive twist\".\nVan Paridon adds that this \"unique phenomenon\" is rooted in the rise of individualism and self-expression, and that China's younger generations are \"on the prowl for ... individual exclusivity\", and while they are looking to separate from previously regulatory norms, they are \"not disposing of their upbringing and heritage\".\n\"What Chinese millennials want from their brands is 'uniqueness', humour, a little bit of swag,\" Van Paridon continues, and concludes that they \"slowly but surely [are] updating their overall fashion acquisition narrative\".\nIndeed, younger Chinese consumers are much more fashion-forward than previous generations. Those who will make up the market in coming years are highly educated, well-travelled, and are increasingly gaining familiarity with voicing a sophisticated and edgy fashion sense their parents may not have dreamed of.\n\"70 per cent of our consumers come from China who are mostly between 20 to 30 years old. There's a big interest from American and Canada too,\" says Qi.\nChinese designers are reimagining what it means to carry the label 'Made in China'. Illustration: Craig Stephens\nGoing after the same Louis Vuitton bags that everyone else already owns is a thing of the past for young consumers, and there is now an increased emphasis on identity expression, rather than the blind following of trends. This is one of the reasons Louis Vuitton closed three of its domestic stores, including its flagship in Guangzhou, following a tremendous slump in sales. Prada and Burberry have done the same.\nVincent Djen, a fashion industry veteran and commentator, supports these claims. \"What I'm seeing now in China is that the younger generation of consumers, the ones born after the 90s, are more willing to buy local brands,\" and he attributes this shift to more refined production standards, and branding that resonates well with \"younger, more sophisticated consumers\", giving new entrants the upper hand in comparison to the more mainstream European labels.\nDjen also notes that the evolving awareness and pride surrounding the \"New Made in China\" is a result of an overall \"product upgrade\" across all industries, led by the likes of automobile and tech. This is certainly the case with brands such as Huawei or ZTE, that see more than half of their income derive from overseas.\nBut how long it will take for this transformation to truly happen in the fashion world? Djen responded, \"It will come. Fashion reflects the evolution of society, culture, and art,\" noting Japan's and Korea's similar momentum over the past three decades. \"Take your time and communicate your brand's story,\" Djen advises emerging designers, and adds that this simple effort is what will elevate success, as opposed to \"just selling products quickly\".\nYounger Chinese consumers are much more fashion-forward than previous generations. Illustration: Craig Stephens\nAs we approach the third financial quarter of what has been a year of havoc across all industries, with luxury fashion a major casualty, a few things are becoming clear. Many fashion brands and retailers are disappearing, creating a more level playing field for new entrants looking to fill the gaps. Throwing on top the fact that global supply chains are still somewhat crippled, this creates a prime opportunity for China's online business-to-consumer (B2C) platforms to use their strengths, which domestic brands understand well.\nIn the wake of a fresh wave of patriotism encouraged by China's prompt response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are left with a significantly more enabling landscape for emerging talent.\nThe awakening of the new and refined Made in China may become a reality sooner than we think. When Chinese consumers embrace and encourage home-grown talent, it will only be a matter of time before it ignites a global trend, where the appeal of the rebranded Made in China label will gain recognition for its quality and authenticity, and makeover previous connotations once and for all.\nConsumer, Market Trends\nchina millennials, chinese local brand, chinese luxury consumers, Luxury, made in china\nFuture Tech China: Branded Games and Social Are Why Alibaba Fails Where Tencent Thrives\nWhy China's Millennials Are Targeting These Silicon Valley Brands\nCCI Q&A: Steven Ekstract on the Year in Content-Commerce"}

The three species currently classified in this genus occur widely in the Americas.\nPhysical charateristics\nThe adult is a very deep black overall, with green and purple sheen. Its eyes are red, its feet black and its beak id flesh coloured. The throat and the sides of the head vary from deep yellow to pale orange, with a blue crown and a blue spot in front of the eyes.\nwingspan min.: 165 cm wingspan max.: 178 cm\nsize min.: 74 cm size max.: 81 cm\nincubation min.: 32 days incubation max.: 40 days\nfledging min.: 70 days fledging max.: 85 days\nbroods: 1 eggs min.: 1\neggs max.: 3\nSouth America : Amazonia\nTypically low tropical forest and less inclined to use open or disturbed forest. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture roosts on high, exposed dead trees to observe surrounding terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, in what is called the dihedral position. The flight of the Greater Yellow-Headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture also has the unusual habit of urohydrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them evaporatively. This behavior is exhibited by storks and New World vultures.\nGreater Yellow-headed Vultures do not build nests, but rather lay their eggs directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial?blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months; eggs are incuated for about five to seven weeks.\nFeeding habits\nThe primary staple of this vulture's diet is carrion, though it is very fond of fish, and may occasionally take them alive. Relies heavily on olfactoin (smell) to detect prey. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture is a scavenger and subsists entirely on carrion. It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal as its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they play an important role in the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture forages using its keen eyesight to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain responsible for processing smells is particularly large compared to other animals. This characteristic of New World Vultures has been used by humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the vultures. King Vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the Greater Yellow-headed Vultures to carcasses, where the King Vulture tears open the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller Greater Yellow-headed Vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both Turkey Vultures and King Vultures, due to their larger size.\nVideo Greater Yellow-headed Vulture\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrjd1H-Zao\ncopyright: J. del Hoyo\nThis species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence <20,000 km2 combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.\nThe Greater Yellow-Headed Vulture inhabits savannas, Grasslands, and Marshes in South America. It ranges from Argentina and Urugay, as far north as Mexico. In Surinam widely spread in the interior, much less common in the coastal planes. Identification of species uncertain due to overlapping range with Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture.\nIrruptive or local migrant\nTags: all of Cathartes, Cathartes melambrotus, Greater Yellow-headed Vulture, New World vultures\nPlanet of Birds © 2020 Frontier Theme"}
{"text": "Connection Issuse after finished print & PC wake-up from sleep.\nAs I am getting into bigger & longer prints I am starting to now notice a issue with connecting to Repetier after I wake-up my PC from its sleep. this is only after a print has finished. The printer will run and finish the print and if I wake it up while it is still printing my connection is fine. It is only after a print has finished when I come back and wake it up that I have this connection issue.\nWhat happens is that I notice in the Log is has a message like this below.\n\"Communication Timeout Reset Send Buffer Block\"\n\"The connection failed with the following error: Incorrect function. Make sure your printer is connected, enabled and connection data is set correct. Open printer settings?\"\nI looked at the Connection Settings go through them and they look fine, tired switching them and it doesn't help. I tried restarting Repetier and it doesn't help. I even try unplugging the USB for the printer and reconnecting it as well as powering it off for a bit and it doesn't help. Only thing that seems to work so far is restarting the PC.\nHas any of you run into this before?\nIf so did you ever figure out what may be the issue?\nWell I figured out what my problem was. It was the set of USB ports I was using. I have a bunch of USB 3.0 ports on the case that connect to my mobo and it seems they are having a bit of a issue for the printer. Once I swapped it with one things connected to a USB 2.0 in the back directly connected to the mobo the printer started working better. Not sure if it is a usb 3.0 or 2.0 thing or just the usb ports on the I/O panel but I am leaning toward the I/O panel as one of my error messages said something about I/O Connection so...... I'll test one of my 3.0 ports in the back that is directly on the mobo to find out 3.0 vs 2.0 thing, but for now I know that my 2.0 port in the back works a lot better.\nAnyways... For anyone that may run into a similar issue like this, just check your ports. I hope this helps you."}

Many guests showed their support at the 40/40 club event including host, Love & Hip Hop celebrity Brittany Taylor and many local artists. The event has increased L Joevon's local fan base and brought awareness to his street outreach programs, teaching the youth to change their perception in order to change their realities.\nReflecting on the turnout, L Joevon stated \"Being an entrepreneur has its ups and downs, but I remain focused on my persevering message. I was pleased to see FYID [NYC] grow my brand [SITC] into a staple of New York's culture.\" A part of the \"culture\" indeed, there was representation from a composite of various burroughs reflecting the diversity of New York. Artists, bloggers, designers all showed support as they watched the new visuals in tandem with SITC documentary making the night a hit in Jay-Z's iconic venue.\nSITC (Seeds In The Concrete ) is a Brooklyn based company founded by L Joevon to promote his cause enriching the inner city youth by encouraging entrepreneurship, writing, and leadership within the community. From teaching the fundamentals of storytelling to demonstrating the value of being a self-starter in stifling environments, this published author delivers his story amongst the obstacles that plague many contemporaries. This masked hero is often misunderstood due to his passion for his art, but is well received in communities that have shared the warmth of sharing light to grow seeds within the urban concrete.\nThese seeds have flourished even into the music scene with plans for more artistic mediums. \"Candy Red\" directed by Complex Magazine's Mario de Armas paints a crimson picture of the struggle to maintain love and individuality. With welcoming R&B vocals of Jon Black and L Joevon personality, the cinematic visuals portrayed the story of Lance & Ayana as part of the first of a series of music videos to accompany the novel.. L Joevon intends to branch into more film and music direction to reach an even wider audience for his cause. Please check out the single and music video, now available online."}

{"text": "On five acres along Three Mile Harbor in Springs, East Hampton Point sits amid an English garden with sailboats swaying in the distance. The country estate vibe gives way to a more lively scene at the property's 58-slip marina, which attracts a steady crowd of locals, sailors and those vacationing at the resort or elsewhere in the Hamptons. It's not uncommon to see fellow guests lingering on the dock as a crew disembarks just steps away.\nThe property's shingled two-story Palmer House contains seven rooms and suites, each with its own entrance. The interiors are appropriately serene, with dark wood and muted blue, yellow and beige accents. All of the rooms are individually designed and the suites have wet bars, private terraces and sitting rooms. For more privacy, Cottage One is removed from the main house in the manicured gardens and has a Queen bedroom and separate sitting area, plus a wet bar and views of the tennis courts.\nExpansive grounds are unusual for hotels in this area, and East Hampton Point puts them to good use. There's a swimming pool and a hard tennis court (plus a playground for little ones). On a nice day it's a pleasure to simply walk around, thanks to slate paths flanked by elm trees that wind around the property. If you do leave the resort, there are dozens of vineyards within driving distance that offer year-round wine tastings, and the hotel gives out parking passes for many of the soft sand beaches nearby. The namesake contemporary American restaurant closes its nautical-themed dining room on Labor Day, but staff are on hand to make reservations at local restaurants throughout the rest of the year.\nVisit the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center to see Jackson Pollock's paintings displayed in the house and barn studio where he lived and worked. For more culture, Guild Hall keeps East Hampton's artistic heritage alive with a year-round slate of plays, concerts, readings, films, special events and art exhibitions. Or live like a true East Hamptonite and hit the shops along Main Street, including the the Ralph Lauren East End Polo flagship, John Varvatos, Blue & Cream and Elie Tahari.\nHave stayed here several times over the past 10 years. I think this last stay was our 4th or 5th. Definitely would recommend the Palmer House accommodations over the cottages. Since the restaurant is no longer part of the hotel (Moby's has leased the space), there was no complimentary breakfast in the restaurant as in years past (Moby's was not open for breakfast, even if one wanted to pay for it). We were told complimentary tea and coffee were offered at the ship's store in the marina. We never bothered, and just went into East Hampton each morning. Although, just an FYI- it is not walking distance.\nWell appointed hotel accommodations for the Hamptons, are a rarity. In this regard, East Hampton Point does stand out. But, not so much with the level of service. Yes, daily housekeeping is provided. Parking passes to Atlantic beach in Amagansett, beach chairs and umbrellas are also available, which was helpful. Think they offer a shuttle service into town, if needed as well. But, still would describe this hotel as more of a property with nice rooms, a tennis court, and a pool. Amanda and Samantha at the front desk are lovely. Although, no one is at the reception area beyond 9-5, or 6pm on the weekends. In other words, the main office hours, are very much that, office hours. The security presence is not compelling whatsoever. There is a phone number in the case of emergencies after hours. Otherwise, higher management was not much of a daily presence on site, if at all during our stay.\nThis is not a 5 star or even a 4 star hotel in the typical sense. Based on the 5 star cost for a stay here, the level of service and amenities do not seem commensurate with the pricing whatsoever. I would suggest looking into Topping Rose in Bridgehampton or Barons Cove in Sag Harbor instead. Still very expensive. But, you will get more value for your money with regard to amenities and services. Just my opinion.\nWe a Beautiful Place, even in the dead of Winter!\nWe came with our son the day after Christmas and fell in love with the Point Hotel.\nThe picture above was actually our exact room, with small living room, bedroom with bathroom downstairs, and a huge Master Suite with bathroom upstairs. It was perfect and we were able to imagine how awesome this would be in the summer! Fair rates and good service!\nEven in the misty weather, my wedding at EHP was so beautiful and perfect. EHP is a place that has been close to my heart for a while now and I couldn't be happier to have hosted my wedding here. The staff was great & accommodating, the food was plentiful & delicious and of course, you can't ask for a better setting. My friends and family took over the hotel and we had a blast on the grounds! Definitely recommend EHP for weddings!!!!\nWe have stayed at most of the upscale places in East Hampton over the years but East Hampton Point is tops in our view. The location on Three Mile Harbor is beautiful with great views of the boats and gorgeous sunsets. Additionally, it was very quiet because it's off the main road. Our room was immaculately clean and well appointed. To our surprise, we had a patio with two lounges, a table and chairs in addition to an umbrella. The restaurant on the premises was a major convenience with breakfast served outside weather permitting. The town is s short distance away. Special shout out to Kristin who was very helpful and accommodating. We don't want to forget Mikey who drove us to Main Beach and picked us up in the van. We met several young families as well as older people like ourselves. A return visit to East Hampton Point is definitely in our future.\nWe have stayed at the Point twice last year once in cottage 9 and cottage 12 and a third time for memorial day weekend this weekend at cottage 8, and to say the least was very disappointed. There was a rat that was running around cottage 8 at 11:45-12:00 a.m. on our first night, Friday, May 26. The rat came out from the area of the refrigerator ran around the kitchen spooked and eventually ran to the side of the dish washer and disappeared. I called the emergency number 2x left a voice mail and never received a return call even the next morning. We came with a small dog and was worried that she was going to get bitten and get rabies. We had to plug the gap between the doors of the bedrooms and the floor so the rat would not be able to enter, we had to make sure our shoes and clothes was not accessible. WE had to re-wash all the cups, glasses, utensils that we were going to use, It was gross. The next morning as soon as the office opened at 9:00 a.m. I called and reported the incidence. I spoke to a gentleman and while I was panicking, his reaction surprised me. He was not even mildly surprised that there was a rat in our cottage and instead when I raised the concern about my little dog, offered to watch our dog for us while we had breakfast! Nice! When I came over to the office to drop my dog I spoke to Kristin, the booking/reservation person in charge and the same reaction! It was even worst bec she had a smile on her face and all she said was \"we'll call an exterminator\" An exterminator came and set traps under the sink - when I already told them it ran towards the dish washer. And then was told that \"in the event our dog got to the poison, she had to eat about 50 of them to be fatal!!!!\" I had to ask if we're not going to be compensated for this grossness at a $750 a night cottage. And her response was \"we'll check with Mike and see what we can do\" for 2 days the only response I got was we'll check with Mike until the day I checked out and not even a free dinner was offered, nor an offer to comp the night the rat was running around our cottage! Not once was there an offer of \"how can we make it up to you\" The worst customer service ever at the price you pay! Because we live in NY, one of the guys who drove us to the beach even said, \"well that's really not different from the rats you see in the subway!!!!\" we did not pay $750 to live in the subway for 2 nights!!!! Disgusting and worst customer service. Perhaps that's why that cottage lacks lighting downstairs, it's dark. Even the bedroom downstairs was dark . Free breakfast? was as lame as a free breakfast can get - 2 straight days, cold bagels, some kind of frittata, not so fresh bacon and pastries. Dinner at the East Hampton Point? expensive even for the Hampton standard and cuisine was nothing great. Not planning on coming back nor recommending to our friends."}
{"text": "Posted in: No Huddle by Brent Lorentson on September 5th, 2013\nThere are so many vampire films, it's hard to get excited any time a trailer for one comes along. The Twilight series as well as shows like True Blood and The Vampire Diaries have managed to take everything I once enjoyed about the menacing creature and turned it into a joke. Let the Right One In and the American remake Let Me In are the last vampire films that had any substance that went for more than cheap thrills and gore and delivered a solid story. That is until Kiss of the Damned came along. It's a film that keeps things simple, yet brings back the beautiful elegance of the creature we loved to fear.\nWhen we first meet Djuna (Josephine de La Baume), she is locked away in her large beautiful home watching an old B&W romance. She's lonely and craves affection, but her affliction of being a vampire doesn't offer many opportunities to meet the dashing male she is looking for. But as her luck would have it, a trip to the video store has Djuna coming face to face with her true love Paolo (Milo Ventimigilia), a screenwriter who has come to town to get away and work on his current project. The two are instantly attracted to one another, but Djuna does all she can to keep Paolo at a distance, afraid of what he may think of her and the harm she may cause. But he's persistent, and in the heat of passion she takes a bite and changes him.\nNo time is wasted with the film; every scene moves the story along, and though it sticks with the traditional views of vampires, Djuna is among a community of other vampires, all of whom are wealthy and powerful but have chosen to not feed on humans but instead on animals and synthetic bloods. As Djuna guides Paolo into the new lifestyle and everything seems to be going well for the two bloodsuckers, Mimi (Roxane Mesquida) comes along. Mimi is not as refined as Djuna despite them being sisters; Mimi relishes the creature she is and doesn't hold back her sexual inhibitions or her hunger for human blood.\nAs Mimi settles into Djuna's home as she awaits going to a vampire detox facility in Phoenix, Mimi spends her time wreaking havoc on the lives of Djuna and Paolo. The subtlety of Mimi's influence is what makes this performance great; we know what she's up to, but she never forces the characters into any situation; she instead just points them in the direction of their weakness whether it be as primal as sex or blood.\nThough the idea of a vampire romance has been done to death, this story manages to remain fresh and even has moments where the vampire lifestyle again feels sexy and inviting. Keeping the vampires grounded in reality, no super speed and no freaking sparkling, allows us to see the humanity that remains in these creatures and that has always been what I felt connected us to them. This embraces the thought of being with your true love, in the prime of your lives and never having to change; it's the fantasy I believe anyone would indulge in if given the chance to make it a reality. Even when Djuna and Paolo cave to their weaknesses, they are able to see beyond the short term pain and appreciate the future that awaits the two of them. Perhaps it's this level of forgiveness that seems so fantasy-like in a time when so many of us who will die will carelessly throw away a relationship with their \"true love\".\nWritten and directed by Xan Cassavetes, the daughter of director John Cassavetes, as a first time feature this has the execution of a director at their prime, and she's only getting started. The camera movements throughout are simple yet beautifully framed, though I did notice at times there seemed to be some editing issues, most notably at the bar when Djuna and Paolo first talk. As the scene cuts between the two their placement seems to move; aside from this scene being a bit off-putting, the rest of the film exceeds and all can be forgiven.\nThough I'd have a hard time putting this film anywhere near the caliber of Let the Right One In, which in my humble opinion I believe to be a masterpiece. Kiss of the Damned is a small film that delivers a bloody and elegant slap to remind us what vampires once were and should be. The horror isn't in how ferocious they are or how hideous they may be; the horror is their ability to seduce us from the life we have and take us to a place darker than we realize.\nScandal: The Complete Second Season\tDa Vinci's Demons: The Complete First Season (Blu-ray)\n09/29/2013\t@ 5:17 am"}

Challenge\nWhen Are You Reading? 2022 Progress\nWhere are You Reading? 2014 Progress\nTag Archives: Organ Donation\nBook Club Reflection: Never Let Me Go by Kazo Ishiguro\nThis was my first time going to a book club without having read the book in the previous month. I know what you're thinking, that I'm falling behind. No, don't think that. I read the book, Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro, in February 2013 and I didn't think it was worth my time to re-read it so soon after. I remembered the book pretty well and only felt disconnected when our group members talked about specific word choice. Not too shabby.\nWe're on a short science fiction kick in this group (and by that I mean this book and the next) and a good place to start in science fiction is the setting. I didn't think too much about the setting when I first read this book, but our moderator said it was supposed to be an alternative 1990s England. I wondered what it was in the 90s that made Ishiguro imagine it so differently. The book was written in 2005 so he was reflecting on a time gone by. Our group proposed that it was the cloning advancements in the 90s that might have spurred this line of thought. I remember as a child hearing about Dolly the Sheep and wondering when my turn to be cloned would be. As a writer, I wonder if Ishiguro thought of the idea for this book in the 90s and didn't get around to writing it until the early 2000s, or has been working on it since the early 2000s.\nWe wondered what was different about this parallel 90s that we didn't see in the book. One member asked why there were so many organ donors needed. It's revealed that there are many places like Hailsham where clones are raised. Is the world Ruth, Kathy, and Tommy live in more overrun with disease that large numbers of organs are needed? Is this an extension of the current National Health System? What organization has put together this system? One option we discussed is that due to advances in medicine and technology, the 'normals' wanted to live longer and to survive into old age, they needed young and healthy organs.\nThe society the 'normals' live in is never really explained well. We wondered if the normals knew that the clones were clones. Was there something about society that they didn't know? Did they dress differently? Speak differently? Was there some way to know that they were not going to live to see 30? I wonder how the normals reacted to these people.\nWe asked each other at what point we started to suspect something was fishy in this world. One of our members only made it a few chapters into the book and she had assumed the characters lived in an orphanage. We felt that it was when donors and carers started coming up that something was fishy. One member thought the book was going to be very medical from the way 'donor' was used. I guess, in a way, she was right. One phrase that was used to describe the setting was 'quietly disturbing.' I love that.\nThe characters in the book grew up in such a strange environment that their development seemed a bit odd. They're all very co-dependent on each other. They don't have families so their relationships with the other children are very important and they're very well aware of group dynamics and keeping everything civil between each other. Kathy and Ruth had a very competitive friendship, but Kathy was always careful to make sure it never came to a head. Tommy was a sort of game between the two girls and even when Kath had feelings for him, she never said anything because he was with Ruth. How much Ruth and Tommy made a good couple or Ruth was using Tommy just to deny him to Kathy is debatable.\nI don't mean at all that the characters were poorly developed. Quite the contrary. They were developed so well that as readers our hearts were wrenched when the characters died. We cheered for Tommy and Kathy when they went to visit Miss Emily and Madame. We hoped they would get a deferment. Instead, the book took a twisted turn and we learned the full truth about Hailsham and the cloning industry. I liked that Ishiguro waited until this far into the book to describe the world more fully. The story of the one boy who tried to run away and had his hands and feet cut off stuck in a lot of our minds. It can only make us think, 'Well, at least things were better at Hailsham.'\nThe question raised by this visit was if the Hailsham kids were better off. On one hand, it's good that they had happy and fulfilling childhoods. Even though they have a bad lot in life to live, they enjoyed it while they were alive. I feel this makes it even sadder when they die. They knew happiness and what it could feel like to enjoy living and then it was cut short. We were conflicted on if we thought the Hailsham kids were lucky or unlucky.\nKath was an interesting narrator to choose. She is very detached from her life and able to describe it in a very abject way. She seems confused by the situation she finds herself in and not really sure how to describe the loss she feels her entire life. She is a carer for so long and sees everyone she loved dying off around her but is very detached from the sadness. We wondered if having her be a carer for so long was a risk to the program. Wouldn't seeing Ruth and Tommy 'complete' (aka DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH) make her more likely to run? In our minds, yes. But in the world Ishiguro created, Kath had to believe on some level that what was being done to her was right and that it was for something greater than herself. And even if she did run, could she blend in to the normal society? She had no paperwork, identification, or anything to prove who she was. There was nowhere for her to go.\nOne of the Hailsham teachers, Miss Lucy, was kicked out of the facility for telling the kids what their future held. We wondered what the best way is to raise someone who will be used for organ donation. Do you tell that person when they're young so that they know their whole life what their future holds? It's a sort of brainwashing, like one hears about in extreme kidnapping cases. Jaycee Dugard didn't run because she was brainwashed with fear. These children were brainwashed to think their bodies and lives belonged to some governmental agency that would kill them in the end.\nCertain plot elements in the story were a bit strange to us. The gallery was one. Why was there so much emphasis put on creativity and art? Funny enough, I saw this video on Facebook today and it helped me answer that question.\nBeing able to create is proof that someone is a sentient being, a living thing capable of thought, process, and creation. (As a side note, I am assuming these elephants are just really well-trained. The idea is that people believe they are capable of creating.) Having the children create art proved the humanity of the clones and that real people were being killed for the organs. We wondered if it was some sort of ethical project to try to boycott the 'organ farms' where the children were raised.\nAnother scene we didn't understand was when they went to see the empty boat. We were confused as to what it meant. The only thing we could come up with is that the boat took a different path than boats are supposed to take. That's why it's on dry land so far from water. We guessed that it was supposed to represent how the world had deviated so far from its normal path and Tommy, Ruth, and Kathy were like stranded boats. It's a weak assumption, but it was the best we had.\nThe final 'What the eff did that mean?' scene was when they went looking for a copy of the tape Kathy wanted. What we liked about it was that they spent their time in the 'real world,' some of their very little time with normals, looking for something that was a memory of their time with other clones. We're not sure what it really meant, but it was a nice nod to how they were stuck in their own reality and detached from the 'real world.'\nThere were two themes I'll discuss before I sign this off. The first is the comparison with animals. There was a reference to how the clones were bred to be sterile and we knew that the 'normals' didn't like this. It gave them a sense of inferiority. There was a guess from one of the clones that they were cloned from prisoners and other undesirables of society so that normals wouldn't feel like the clones were better than them. We kind of saw this as similar to animals raised for food. There are genetically modified chickens specifically used for large chicken breasts or more tender meat. Is that any better? Is the way science can change things creepy and too invasive? Some people are vegetarians because of this treatment. Were there people in the book's universe who wouldn't take organ donations because of the treatment of the donors? The characters had several connections to animals that made us wonder what kind of connection we were supposed to draw. Tommy's art in the latter part of the book is of animal hybrids. Ruth talks about wanting to ride horses. However, there were never real animals, only drawings and references to them. We wondered what Ishiguro was trying to say.\nThe other interesting topic was sexuality. Because they couldn't get pregnant, the characters had very little pause about having sex with each other. It was a very casual thing and they engaged in it because it felt good and for little other reason. Kathy doesn't even deem her experiences important enough to tell the reader until she's accused of not having had sex (if I recall correctly). The only concern was disease but by keeping it within the clones, that was not an issue. However, our moderator recalled that they had a negative and childish attitude toward gay sex, but our group couldn't figure out why that would be. Any ideas?\nIshiguro's writing is really engaging. I've read this book and also The Remains of the Day and I have to say I much prefer this title. He has a great style of adding enough detail to bring a passage to life without bogging it down. He likes to write about people who have a certain lot in life that can't change and what they do with it. In his own words:\nIt's something I do instinctively in my writing and with this book it was a very important feature that escape was not an option. It's about how we're all aware of our fate, in that we have a limited time in life. Escape isn't an issue in the book, because it's never really an option in our own lives. Characters like Stevens and the kids in Never Let Me Go do what we all do; try to give meaning to our lives by fulfilling some sort of duty.\nUntil next time, write on.\nYou can follow me on Goodreads, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram.

So when i went on a hunt to highlight those that were incorporating a patriotic flair to their homes without making it look \"country\" or even political (yikes), I knew I'd have my work cut out for me.\nHowever, I do love the look of a vintage American flag. Much like my obsession with old maps, I could horde old flags until my bank account was at $0, and then I'd still find a way to get another one.

Donations also can be dropped off.\n\"This family has suffered and lost an amazing young man!

Haley, who ran 10-mile routes and swam laps at a local pool two times a week, wouldn't have skipped a workout, even on Christmas Eve, Poe added.\nThat's just what Haley was doing Tuesday evening around 5:30 p.m., when police said he was struck in the southbound lane of Winterstown Road in the Red Lion area.\nWearing a reflective band and headphones, Haley was hit by a car driven by 21-year-old Briar Sullivan of Red Lion, according to York Area Regional Police.\nHaley hit the driver side front and windshield, police said, and was thrown into the northbound lane into the path of a pickup driven by John Warner, 65, of Winterstown.\nHaley was then run over by the pickup, police said.\nHe was transported to York Hospital where he later died in the operating room at 8:54 p.m., Deputy Coroner Claude Stabley said.\nThe cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma, Stabley said. There will be no autopsy.\nThe North Hopewell-Winterstown Volunteer Fire Co.'s Facebook page quickly filled with comments on Christmas morning from those who knew him.\n\"He was very dedicated with what he does,\" Poe said.\nThe crash happened just in front of the home of another department volunteers, who ran outside to direct traffic at the scene. It wasn't until paramedics arrived and turned Haley over that the firefighter realized who it was, Poe said.\nHis department has taken the loss to heart, he said.\n\"It's a brotherhood and a sisterhood,\" Poe said.\nPoe described him as someone who was always willing to help. He took extra classes at the York County Fire School and always volunteered to help. He would text Poe every day and asked if there was anything he could do at the station.\n\"It's hard on our members to lose someone so young who had so much potential,\" he said.\nWhat he'll remember about Haley is that he had \"the biggest heart,\" he said.\nPlans for a memorial have not yet been finalized, Poe said.\n(c)2013 York Daily Record (York, Pa.)\nVisit York Daily Record (York, Pa.) at www.ydr.com\nOff Duty DeathPennsylvania\nPrevious article Moooooo: Oregon Firefighters Rescue Cow from In-Ground Swimming Pool [Photos]\nNext article Can't Make This Stuff Up: U.K. Firefighters Rescue Three People EVERY DAY from Bathroom Entrapment\nYoung Firefighter Lost: Pennsylvania Firefighter Struck, Killed While Jogging — Planned to Enlist in Air Force\nCaught on video: The mean streets of Philly\nRaw video: Multi-alarm fire & MCI at Pennsylvania senior complex\nRaw video from Philadelphia house fire\nMoooooo: Oregon Firefighters Rescue Cow from In-Ground Swimming Pool [Photos]\nCan't Make This Stuff Up: U.K. Firefighters Rescue Three People EVERY DAY from Bathroom Entrapment"}

It was off from 8 a.m. to about 7 p.m., when it should have been back on at 4 p.m.\n\"The water went back off early this morning,\" she said, adding, \"the street has been a mess since this project started. Lanes have been restricted and deep large holes left open for weeks with water constantly running down Jarvis.\n\"My concern is the time this is taking and the seemingly unbelievable mess that is left behind on a daily basis. There seems to be no attempt to keep the work areas tidy.\n\"It looks like a fiasco, a very messy one.\"\nWe went there and saw that two lanes of northbound traffic were squeezed into one, from south of Queen St. to just north of Dundas St., where condo construction is occupying the curb lane.\nSouthbound traffic is also narrowed to one lane between Dundas and Queen, which slows it to a crawl on a key route used by drivers to get in and out of the downtown core during rush hour.\nWe watched last week as a line of vehicles inched northward through the lane reduction at the start of the afternoon rush; it took upwards of 10 minutes for drivers to get from Queen to north of Dundas.\nStatus: Susan Pape, a spokesperson for the city, emailed to confirm that the lane reductions are necessary to replace \"two vintage water mains, both over 100 years old, with a new, larger diameter water main,\" to improve local service. The work was delayed, \"however it is near completion and all lanes are scheduled to reopen by the end of January. There are no other temporary water shut-offs planned (or) associated with this work.\"\nShe went on to say delays in completing the project were caused by a change in plans that allowed the city to install new water mains closer to private properties, which will improve service, and also for rigorous testing of water quality, required by the provincial environment ministry.\nA condo project at Dundas and Jarvis that is occupying the curb lane is scheduled for completion by the end of June, said Pape.\nWhat's broken in your neighbourhood?

{"text": "I graduated from Thunderbird High in 1983 in a royal blue gown, which I wore over the same royal blue sundress and with strappy white flats, so I wouldn't sink into the football field. No fewer than 127 bobby pins held my cap snug.\nThe principal and administrators filled their folding chairs on the stage as we lined up, boys on one side, girls on the other, and swore we'd never forget – not how Mr. Prochnau gave us extra credit in biology if we wore a shoelace necklace of dissected pig parts, or drinking Boone's Farm Tickle Pink on the golf course at the Moon Valley Country Club, nor one another. Not ever.\nThe speeches that night were endless, reaching me near the front because my last name started with a B first and echoing back to the Z's.\nThese had been the best years of our lives.\nWe were the future. We were the best and the brightest. We could do anything. We had an obligation to change the world.\nAll we had to do was be true to ourselves, follow our dreams and reach for the stars.\nI believed every word.\nI've been to a lot of high school graduations since my own. I go to a few more every year, it seems. Not much has changed.\nThey're still wearing the same outfits and playing much of the same music with the same pomp and circumstance. The same people line the stage on folding chairs – the principal and other administrators, the school board and distinguished guests.\nEven the speeches have stayed pretty much the same, with minor variations on the theme.\nIn speech after speech, we're reminded how the last four years have just flown by, how they started as freshman who got lost in the hallways, it feels like just yesterday, and look at where they are now.\nInsert here the requisite funny prank pulled on (easy-going teacher's name), hilarious incident at (annual talent show/fall festival/pep rally) and inside joke from three-day school trip to (name of place within six-hour bus ride here).\nBest years of their lives. Friends forever.\nBut this isn't an ending, oh, no, it's only the beginning. They are the future.\nIt was a journey of a thousand miles that began with a single step, and whenever one door closed, another opened, but now the path ahead was clear. They have only to be true to themselves, follow their dreams, reach for the stars.\nAnd if you don't want to take the speakers' word for it, they quote an (adult) expert. Henry David Thoreau. Les Brown.\nRalph Waldo Emerson. Walt Disney. Dr. Seuss.\nI sit in the bleachers, listening, and smile wryly. I tick off the clichés: You are the future. Don't be afraid to fail. Make a difference.\nThis year, the valedictorian who spoke at McClintock High, Trinny Tat, was refreshingly real.\nFirst of all, she promised to keep it short. \"I don't want you all to fall asleep,\" she said.\nTrinny did speak of surviving standardized testing and supplementing suspect lunches with cookies sold by DECA, Rice KrispiesTreats from swim team and dance club fundraisers and candy bars from orchestra.\n\"I know we are anxious about our future, but keep it real,\" she said. \"I am gonna be a freeloader as long as I can. And you can too as long as your parents don't throw you out in the street.\"\nParents in the stands chuckled.\nTrinny quoted Will Rogers: \"Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there.\"\nTrinny is from Vietnam and started school here seven years ago in English Language Learner classes. She told her classmates, \"Without putting effort, one will just sit at one place and not going anywhere even if the path is right. At the same time, other people are taking that chance, that direction to get to the place you were going to.\n\"The world is a judgmental place. The world is a scary place. The world is not fair, but deal with it because other people are experiencing the same thing.\"\nDon't just dream about it, she was telling them. Do the work.\nShe was on to something. Listening to her made me think about just what I would tell a football stadium full of high school graduates, if given the chance.\nYou can be anything you want to be, but you have to do the work and pay your dues.\nThese might feel like the best years of your life — so far — especially since you were just coming out of the agony of middle school. Trust me, there are even better years ahead.\nIf you hated high school, for whatever reason, there's a good chance you will love college. It's bigger, and more diverse, you'll find people like you. Those may well be the friends you'll keep forever.\nListen to what the commencement speakers are saying because when you're young, these things are all true, and no one wants to tell you any different. That's why everyone is smiling at you, like you're a toddler taking your first steps.\nBecause basically, you are.\nWhile you're reaching for those stars, you're going to make some mistakes. Some of them will feel like they're fatal mistakes. They're not. Know that there are few things that can't be fixed. Ask for help.\nFind a mentor.\nThank your teachers.\nLearn about technology. Or, whatever you study, put the word \"forensic\" in front of it – forensic psychology, forensic accounting.\nIt's not really true what they say (I say \"they\" because no one knows who for sure), that if you do what you love, you'll never work another day in your life. Because even if you love it, it's still work. It'll get you down sometimes. That's OK.\nPay attention to your parents. Call them regularly. They did a lot for you.\nPay attention to the local news. Vote.\nRead. Drive safely. Give to charity. (Donating blood doesn't cost anything.)\nMake sure everybody gets a fair chance. (Oh, you think there's no more gender barrier? Then why are half of you still wearing different colored robes and sitting on opposite sides of the aisle?)\nTake care of yourself. I don't mean manicures and pedicures or gym memberships. I mean, go outside. Look up from your screen occasionally. Drink plenty of water. Eat vegetables. Get enough sleep. Moderate your drinking. Don't smoke. Do wear sunscreen.\nAnd just do your best. Try not to compare yourself to others. Stretch yourself. Know it's OK to be scared. In fact you should be scared sometimes.\nIt's not as easy as living your dreams and being yourself.\nBut it's also not as hard as being the entire future, carrying the responsibility to change the whole world.\nJust don't give up.\nYou'll be fine.\nReach Bland at karina.bland@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8614."}

{"text": "Origin Part V\nSome things are better left undiscovered!\nCharlie silently followed her as she stepped across the threshold, and as she did a faint blue glow illuminated the center of the room. She stopped and stepped back, suddenly unsure if she should continue, and the blue light faded to darkness. Stepping forward again, she was rewarded with the return of that blue glow that seemed to emanate from the center of the room.\nFollowing the beam of her flashlight, they both ventured deeper into the chamber, coming to a stone bench on their right. She played the beam of the flashlight over the dust-covered surface of the bench, noting how it curved to the left as it vanished into the shadows. There was another bench thee feet in front of the first, it too curving into the emptiness that pressed in on all sides. With growing confidence she pushed on, coming to a third bench in front of the second one.\nAs they ventured deeper into the chamber, she slowly became aware that the blue glow was coming from an object to her immediate front. She stopped, took a deep breath, and switched off her flashlight.\n\"Turn off your light,\" she said.\nCharlie complied and as her eyes adjusted to the darkness the blue glow grew stronger until she could make out the shape of a large blue globe hanging suspended an unknown distance before her. More details came into focus and she began picking out tiny spots of light high above her head all around her. The image reminded her of a planetarium during a showing and she suddenly realized that what she was gazing upon was the home world of whatever had built this structure.\n\"See what?\"\n\"Close your eyes for a minute and let them adjust to the dark.\" Sandra closed her own eyes and when she reopened them that alien solar system was once again laid out before her with that faint blue sun in the center.\n\"What the hell,\" Charlie said.\n\"I think that's why they came here.\"\n\"Those who built this structure. Their sun was dying.\"\n\"A star system, their home.\"\n\"Of course, who did you think I was talking about?\"\n\"How can you be so sure?\"\n\"I'm not absolutely certain. Not one hundred percent. But the explanation fits.\"\n\"Then where are they now?\"\nSandra shrugged. \"I don't know.\"\nThey had moved forward to a raised dais a foot higher than the rest of the floor. Stepping up together, they approached the blue sphere, beneath which rested a small white box. Charlie reached the item first, marveling at the craftsmanship that had gone into constructing this small object. It looked like fine marble cut into very thin sheets, somewhat transparent, its contents were a faint smudge against the white.\n\"What is it?\" Charlie said.\n\"I don't know.\" Sandra touched the surface of the box and when she did her mind was suddenly filled with ancient images of an alien place that was all but a memory.\nShe saw a vast valley beneath a blue sun. From the floor of the valley rose an immense tower. The spires of Beizel in the valley of tears. The name came to her from the black depths of a consciousness that stretched into the antediluvian void of their past. She could feel them around her, the followers who had trekked to this desolate plain, and the faithful who had come to seek redemption. Their thoughts washed over and around her, a single voice in a seething populace whose movements were so perfectly timed they took on the appearance of the surface of the ocean as gentle swells raced from one end to the other in a continuous cycle.\nThey had come seeking salvation and found it in the singularity of one thought that washed through them with a solitary voice. The individual parts of the whole had come together to form a distinct thought, and that was survival of the species. Their sun was dying, the time for the planet, for their reign, had come to a close.
